<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Scope and Scope Exceptions Section outlines the items (for example, the entities, transactions, instruments, or events) to which the guidance in the Subtopic does or does not apply. In some cases, the Section may contain definitional or other text to frame the scope.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note for Financial Instruments: </b>Some of the items subject to the guidance in this Subtopic are <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">financial instruments</u>.

</p><p id="41015">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-1   </b>The guidance in this Subtopic applies to all entities, including rate-regulated entities that meet the criteria for application of Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">980-10</u>, as provided in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">980-10-15-2</u>. Paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">980-340-25-1</u> and <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">980-405-25-1</u> provide specific conditions that must be met to recognize a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability, respectively. (See paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-55-1 through 55-12</u> and <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-55-21 through 55-22</u> for implementation guidance)
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Transactions</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-2   </b>The guidance in this Subtopic applies to the following transactions and activities: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Legal obligations</b> associated with the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">retirement</b> of a tangible long-lived asset that result from the acquisition, construction, or development and (or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset, including any legal obligations that require <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">disposal</b> of a replaced part that is a component of a tangible long-lived asset.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  An environmental remediation liability that results from the normal operation of a long-lived asset and that is associated with the retirement of that asset. The fact that partial settlement of an obligation is required or performed before full retirement of an asset does not remove that obligation from the scope of this Subtopic. If environmental contamination is incurred in the normal operation of a long-lived asset and is associated with the retirement of that asset, then this Subtopic will apply (and Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-30</u> will not apply) if the entity is legally obligated to treat the contamination. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  A conditional obligation to perform a retirement activity. Uncertainty about the timing of settlement of the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">asset retirement obligation</b> does not remove that obligation from the scope of this Subtopic but will affect the measurement of a liability for that obligation (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-10</u>). 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Obligations of a lessor in connection with leased property that meet the provisions in (a). Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">840-10-25-16</u> requires that lease classification tests performed in accordance with the requirements of Subtopic 840-10 incorporate the requirements of this Subtopic to the extent applicable. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  The costs associated with the retirement of a specified asset that qualifies as historical waste equipment as defined by EU Directive 2002/96/EC. (See paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-55-23 through 55-30</u> and Example 4 [paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-55-63</u>] for illustration of this guidance.) Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-55-24</u> explains how the Directive distinguishes between new and historical waste and provides related implementation guidance. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-3   </b>The guidance in this Subtopic does not apply to the following transactions and activities: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Obligations that arise solely from a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of a long-lived asset covered by Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10</u>. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  An environmental remediation liability that results from the improper operation of a long-lived asset (see Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-30</u>). Obligations resulting from improper operations do not represent costs that are an integral part of the tangible long-lived asset and therefore should not be accounted for as part of the cost basis of the asset. For example, a certain amount of spillage may be inherent in the normal operations of a fuel storage facility, but a catastrophic accident caused by noncompliance with an entity's safety procedures is not. The obligation to clean up the spillage resulting from the normal operation of the fuel storage facility is within the scope of this Subtopic. The obligation to clean up after the catastrophic accident results from the improper use of the facility and is not within the scope of this Subtopic. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Activities necessary to prepare an asset for an alternative use as they are not associated with the retirement of the asset. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Historical waste held by private households. (The guidance in this paragraph does not pertain to an asset retirement obligation in the scope of this Subtopic.) For guidance on accounting for historical electronic equipment waste held by private households for obligations associated with Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment adopted by the European Union, see Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">720-40</u>. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  Obligations of a lessee in connection with leased property, whether imposed by a lease agreement or by a party other than the lessor, that meet the definition of either minimum lease payments or contingent rentals in paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">840-10-25-4 through 25-7</u>. Those obligations shall be accounted for by the lessee in accordance with the requirements of Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">840-10</u>. However, if obligations of a lessee in connection with leased property, whether imposed by a lease agreement or by a party other than the lessor, meet the provisions in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-15-2</u> but do not meet the definition of either minimum lease payments or contingent rentals in paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">840-10-25-4 through 25-7</u>, those obligations shall be accounted for by the lessee in accordance with the requirements of this Subtopic. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.  An obligation for asbestos removal that results from the other-than-normal operation of an asset. Such an obligation may be subject to the provisions of Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-30</u>. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">g.  Costs associated with complying with funding or assurance provisions. Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-35-9</u> otherwise addresses the measurement effects of funding and assurance provisions. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">h.  Obligations associated with maintenance, rather than retirement, of a long-lived asset. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">i.  The cost of a replacement part that is a component of a long-lived asset.
