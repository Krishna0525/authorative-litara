<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">If a corporation redeems its stock (within the meaning of section 317(b)), and if paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) of subsection (b) applies, such redemption shall be treated as a distribution in part or full payment in exchange for the stock.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>(1)Redemptions not equivalent to dividends</b></p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>(C)Definitions For purposes of this paragraph, the distribution is substantially disproportionate if—</b></p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>(i)</b> the ratio which the voting stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder immediately after the redemption bears to all of the voting stock of the corporation at such time,is less than 80 percent of—</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>(ii)</b> the ratio which the voting stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder immediately before the redemption bears to all of the voting stock of the corporation at such time.For purposes of this paragraph, no distribution shall be treated as substantially disproportionate unless the shareholder’s ownership of the common stock of the corporation (whether voting or nonvoting) after and before redemption also meets the 80 percent requirement of the preceding sentence. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if there is more than one class of common stock, the determinations shall be made by reference to fair market value.</p>
