<i>AU-C Section 316 CONSIDERATION OF FRAUD IN A FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUDIT</i>
</b>
</p><p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>Introduction and Overview</b>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>Section 110, <i>Responsibilities and Functions of the Independent Auditor</i>, paragraph .02, states, "The auditor has a responsibility to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud. [footnote omitted]" This section establishes standards and provides guidance to auditors in fulfilling that responsibility, as it relates to fraud, in an audit of financial statements conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS).
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02</b>The following is an overview of the organization and content of this section:
<ul>
	<li>
		<i>Description and characteristics of fraud.</i> This section describes fraud and its characteristics. (See paragraphs .05 through .12.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>The importance of exercising professional skepticism.</i> This section discusses the need for auditors to exercise professional skepticism when considering the possibility that a material misstatement due to fraud could be present. (See paragraph .13.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Discussion among engagement personnel regarding the risks of material misstatement due to fraud.</i> This section requires, as part of planning the audit, that there be a discussion among the audit team members to consider how and where the entity's financial statements might be susceptible to material misstatement due to fraud and to reinforce the importance of adopting an appropriate mindset of professional skepticism. (See paragraphs .14 through .18.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Obtaining the information needed to identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud.</i> This section requires the auditor to gather information necessary to identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud, by
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				Inquiring of management and others within the entity about the risks of fraud. (See paragraphs .20 through .27.)
			</li>
			<li>
				Considering the results of the analytical procedures performed in planning the audit. (See paragraphs .28 through .30.)
			</li>
			<li>
				Considering fraud risk factors. (See paragraphs .31 through .33, and the Appendix, "Examples of Fraud Risk Factors" [paragraph .85].)
			</li>
			<li>
				Considering certain other information. (See paragraph .34.)
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Identifying risks that may result in a material misstatement due to fraud.</i> This section requires the auditor to use the information gathered to identify risks that may result in a material misstatement due to fraud. (See paragraphs .35 through .42.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Assessing the identified risks after taking into account an evaluation of the entity's programs and controls.</i> This section requires the auditor to evaluate the entity's programs and controls that address the identified risks of material misstatement due to fraud, and to assess the risks taking into account this evaluation. (See paragraphs .43 through .45.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Responding to the results of the assessment.</i> This section emphasizes that the auditor's response to the risks of material misstatement due to fraud involves the application of professional skepticism when gathering and evaluating audit evidence. (See paragraph .46 through .49.) The section requires the auditor to respond to the results of the risk assessment in three ways:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				A response that has an overall effect on how the audit is conducted, that is, a response involving more general considerations apart from the specific procedures otherwise planned. (See paragraph .50.)
			</li>
			<li>
				A response to identified risks that involves the nature, timing, and extent of the auditing procedures to be performed. (See paragraphs .51 through .56.)
			</li>
			<li>
				A response involving the performance of certain procedures to further address the risk of material misstatement due to fraud involving management override of controls. (Seeparagraphs .57 through .67.)
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Evaluating audit evidence. </i>This section requires the auditor to assess the risks of material misstatement due to fraud throughout the audit and to evaluate at the completion of the audit whether the accumulated results of auditing procedures and other observations affect the assessment. (See paragraphs .68 through .74.) It also requires the auditor to consider whether identified misstatements may be indicative of fraud and, if so, directs the auditor to evaluate their implications. (See paragraphs .75 through .78.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Communicating about fraud to management, those charged with governance, and others.</i> This section provides guidance regarding the auditor's communications about fraud to management, those charged with governance, and others. (See paragraphs .79 through .82.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Documenting the auditor's consideration of fraud. </i>This section describes related documentation requirements. (See paragraph .83.)

<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03</b> The requirements and guidance set forth in this section are intended to be integrated into an overall audit process, in a logical manner that is consistent with the requirements and guidance provided in other sections, including section 311, <i>Planning and Supervision; section 312, Audit Risk and Materiality in Conducting an Audit; section 314, Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement, and section 318 Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained.</i> Even though some requirements and guidance set forth in this section are presented in a manner that suggests a sequential audit process, auditing in fact involves a continuous process of gathering, updating, and analyzing information throughout the audit. Accordingly the sequence of the requirements and guidance in this section may be implemented differently among audit engagements. [Revised, March 2006, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statements on Auditing Standards No. 109 and No. 110.]
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04</b> Although this section focuses on the auditor's consideration of fraud in an audit of financial statements, it is management's responsibility to design and implement programs and controls to prevent, deter, and detect fraud. fn 3 That responsibility is described in section 110.03, which states, "Management is responsible for adopting sound accounting policies and for establishing and maintaining internal control that will, among other things, authorize, record, process, and report transactions (as well as events and conditions) consistent with management's assertions embodied in the financial statements." Management, along with those charged with governance, should set the proper tone; create and maintain a culture of honesty and high ethical standards; and establish appropriate controls to prevent, deter, and detect fraud. When management and those charged with governance fulfill those responsibilities, the opportunities to commit fraud can be reduced significantly.

<br/><br/>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Description and Characteristics of Fraud</b>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05 </b>Fraud is a broad legal concept and auditors do not make legal determinations of whether fraud has occurred. Rather, the auditor's interest specifically relates to acts that result in a material misstatement of the financial statements. The primary factor that distinguishes fraud from error is whether the underlying action that results in the misstatement of the financial statements is intentional or unintentional. For purposes of the section, fraud is an intentional act that results in a material misstatement in financial statements that are the subject of an audit. 
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06 </b>Two types of misstatements are relevant to the auditor's consideration of fraudâ€”misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting and misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets.
<ul>
	<li>
		<i>Misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting</i> are intentional misstatements or omissions of amounts or disclosures in financial statements designed to deceive financial statement users where the effect causes the financial statements not to be presented, in all material respects, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Fraudulent financial reporting may be accomplished by the following:
		<ul type="circle">
			<li>
				Manipulation, falsification, or alteration of accounting records or supporting documents from which financial statements are prepared
			</li>
			<li>
				Misrepresentation in or intentional omission from the financial statements of events, transactions, or other significant information
			</li>
			<li>
				Intentional misapplication of accounting principles relating to amounts, classification, manner of presentation, or disclosure Fraudulent financial reporting need not be the result of a grand plan or conspiracy. It may be that management representatives rationalize the appropriateness of a material misstatement, for example, as an aggressive rather than indefensible interpretation of complex accounting rules, or as a temporary misstatement of financial statements, including interim statements, expected to be corrected later when operational results improve.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets </i>(sometimes referred to as theft or defalcation) involve the theft of an entity's assets where the effect of the theft causes the financial statements not to be presented, in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP. Misappropriation of assets can be accomplished in various ways, including embezzling receipts, stealing assets, or causing an entity to pay for goods or services that have not been received. Misappropriation of assets may be accompanied by false or misleading records or documents, possibly created by circumventing controls. The scope of this section includes only those misappropriations of assets for which the effect of the misappropriation causes the financial statements not to be fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP.
	</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07</b>	Three conditions generally are present when fraud occurs. First, management or other employees have an <i>incentive</i> or are under <i>pressure</i>, which provides a reason to commit fraud. Second, circumstances existâ€”for example, the absence of controls, ineffective controls, or the ability of management to override controlsâ€”that provide an <i>opportunity</i> for a fraud to be perpetrated. Third, those involved are able to <i>rationalize</i> committing a fraudulent act. Some individuals possess an <i>attitude</i>, character, or set of ethical values that allow them to knowingly and intentionally commit a dishonest act. However, even otherwise honest individuals can commit fraud in an environment that imposes sufficient pressure on them. The greater the incentive or pressure, the more likely an individual will be able to rationalize the acceptability of committing fraud.
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08</b> Management has a unique ability to perpetrate fraud because it frequently is in a position to directly or indirectly manipulate accounting records and present fraudulent financial information. Fraudulent financial reporting often involves management override of controls that otherwise may appear to be operating effectively.Management can either direct employees to perpetrate fraud or solicit their help in carrying it out. In addition, management personnel at a component of the entity may be in a position to manipulate the accounting records of the component in a manner that causes a material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements of the entity. Management override of controls can occur in unpredictable ways.
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09</b> Typically, management and employees engaged in fraud will take steps to conceal the fraud from the auditors and others within and outside the organization. Fraud may be concealed by withholding evidence or misrepresenting information in response to inquiries or by falsifying documentation. For example, management that engages in fraudulent financial reporting might alter shipping documents. Employees or members of management who misappropriate cash might try to conceal their thefts by forging signatures or falsifying electronic approvals on disbursement authorizations. An audit conducted in accordance with GAAS rarely involves the authentication of such documentation, nor are auditors trained as or expected to be experts in such authentication. In addition, an auditor may not discover the existence of a modification of documentation through a side agreement that management or a third party has not disclosed.
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.10</b> Fraud also may be concealed through collusion among management, employees, or third parties. Collusion may cause the auditor who has properly performed the audit to conclude that evidence provided is persuasive when it is, in fact, false. For example, through collusion, false evidence that controls have been operating effectively may be presented to the auditor, or consistent misleading explanations may be given to the auditor by more than one individual within the entity to explain an unexpected result of an analytical procedure. As another example, the auditor may receive a false confirmation from a third party that is in collusion with management.
<br/><br/> 
 <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11</b> Although fraud usually is concealed and management's intent is difficult to determine, the presence of certain conditions may suggest to the auditor the possibility that fraud may exist. For example, an important contract may be missing, a subsidiary ledger may not be satisfactorily reconciled to its control account, or the results of an analytical procedure performed during the audit may not be consistent with expectations. However, these conditions may be the result of circumstances other than fraud. Documents may legitimately have been lost or misfiled; the subsidiary ledger may be out of balance with its control account because of an unintentional accounting error; and unexpected analytical relationships may be the result of unanticipated changes in underlying economic factors. Even reports of alleged fraud may not always be reliable because an employee or outsider may be mistaken or may be motivated for unknown reasons to make a false allegation.
 <br/><br/>
 <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12</b> As indicated in paragraph .01, the auditor has a responsibility to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. fn 7 However, absolute assurance is not attainable and thus even a properly planned and performed audit may not detect a material misstatement resulting from fraud. A material misstatement may not be detected because of the nature of audit evidence or because the characteristics of fraud as discussed above may cause the auditor to rely unknowingly on audit evidence that appears to be valid, but is, in fact, false and fraudulent. Furthermore, audit procedures that are effective for detecting an error may be ineffective for detecting fraud.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Importance of Exercising Professional Skepticism</b>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.13 </b>Due professional care requires the auditor to exercise professional skepticism. See section 230,Due Professional Care in the Performance of Work, paragraphs .07 through .09. Because of the characteristics of fraud, the auditor's exercise of professional skepticism is important when considering the risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Professional skepticism is an attitude that includes a questioning mind and a critical assessment of audit evidence. The auditor should conduct the engagement with a mindset that recognizes the possibility that a material misstatement due to fraud could be present, regardless of any past experience with the entity and regardless of the auditor's belief about management's honesty and integrity. Furthermore, professional skepticism requires an ongoing questioning of whether the information and evidence obtained suggests that a material misstatement due to fraud has occurred. In exercising professional skepticism in gathering and evaluating evidence, the auditor should not be satisfied with less-than-persuasive evidence because of a belief that management is honest.
</p><br/>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Discussion Among Engagement Personnel Regarding the Risks of Material Misstatement Due to Fraud</b>
</p> 	
<br/>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.14 </b>Prior to or in conjunction with the information-gathering procedures described in paragraphs .19 through .34 of this section, members of the audit team should discuss the potential for material misstatement due to fraud. The discussion should include:
<ul>
	<li>
		An exchange of ideas or "brainstorming" among the audit team members, including the auditor with final responsibility for the audit, about how and where they believe the entity's financial statements might be susceptible to material misstatement due to fraud, how management could perpetrate and conceal fraudulent financial reporting, and how assets of the entity could be misappropriated. (See paragraph .15.)
	</li>
	<li>
		An emphasis on the importance of maintaining the proper state of mind throughout the audit regarding the potential for material misstatement due to fraud. (See paragraph .16.)
	</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.15 </b>The discussion among the audit team members about the susceptibility of the entity's financial statements to material misstatement due to fraud should include a consideration of the known external and internal factors affecting the entity that might (a) create incentives/pressures for management and others to commit fraud, (b) provide the opportunity for fraud to be perpetrated, and (c) indicate a culture or environment that enables management to rationalize committing fraud. The discussion should occur with an attitude that includes a questioning mind as described in paragraph .16 and, for this purpose, setting aside any prior beliefs the audit team members may have that management is honest and has integrity. In this regard, the discussion should include a consideration of the risk of management override of controls. fn 8 Finally, the discussion should include how the auditor might respond to the susceptibility of the entity's financial statements to material misstatement due to fraud.
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16 </b>The discussion among the audit team members should emphasize the need to maintain a questioning mind and to exercise professional skepticism in gathering and evaluating evidence throughout the audit, as described in paragraph .13. This should lead the audit team members to continually be alert for information or other conditions (such as those presented in paragraph .68) that indicate a material misstatement due to fraud may have occurred. It should also lead audit team members to thoroughly probe the issues, acquire additional evidence as necessary, and consult with other team members and, if appropriate, experts in the firm, rather than rationalize or dismiss information or other conditions that indicate a material misstatement due to fraud may have occurred.
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.17 </b>Although professional judgment should be used in determining which audit team members should be included in the discussion, the discussion ordinarily should involve the key members of the audit team. A number of factors will influence the extent of the discussion and how it should occur. For example, if the audit involves more than one location, there could be multiple discussions with team members in differing locations. Another factor to consider in planning the discussions is whether to include specialists assigned to the audit team. For example, if the auditor has determined that a professional possessing information technology skills is needed on the audit team (see section 311.31), it may be useful to include that individual in the discussion. [Revised, March 2006, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 108.]
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.18 </b>Communication among the audit team members about the risks of material misstatement due to fraud also should continue throughout the auditâ€”for example, in evaluating the risks of material misstatement due to fraud at or near the completion of the field work. (See paragraph .74 and footnote 28.)
</p>
<br/>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obtaining the Information Needed to Identify the Risks of Material Misstatement Due to Fraud</b>
</p><br/>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc33022">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.19 </b>Section 314 provides guidance about how the auditor obtains an understanding of the entity and its environment, including its internal control. In performing that work, information may come to the auditor's attention that should be considered in identifying risks of material misstatement due to fraud. As part of this work, the auditor should perform the following procedures to obtain information that is used (as described in paragraphs .35 through .42) to identify the risks of material misstatement due to fraud:
<ol type="a">
	<li>
		Make inquiries of management and others within the entity to obtain their views about the risks of fraud and how they are addressed. (See paragraphs .20 through .27.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Consider any unusual or unexpected relationships that have been identified in performing analytical procedures in planning the audit. (See paragraphs .28 through .30.)	
	</li>
	<li>
		The specialist's experience in the type of work under consideration.
	</li>
	<li>
		Consider other information that may be helpful in the identification of risks of material misstatement due to fraud. (See paragraph .34.)
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
[Revised, March 2006, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 109.]
<br/><br/>
Making Inquiries of Management and Others Within the Entity About the Risks of Fraud
</p>
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.20	</b>The auditor should inquire of management about:
<ul>
	<li>
		Whether management has knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity.
	</li>
	<li>
		Whether management is aware of allegations of fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity, for example, received in communications from employees, former employees, analysts, regulators, short sellers, or others
	</li>
	<li>
		Management's understanding about the risks of fraud in the entity, including any specific fraud risks the entity has identified or account balances or classes of transactions for which a risk of fraud may be likely to exist
	</li>
	<li>
		Programs and controls the entity has established to mitigate specific fraud risks the entity has identified, or that otherwise help to prevent, deter, and detect fraud, and how management monitors those programs and controls. For examples of programs and controls an entity may implement to prevent, deter, and detect fraud, see the exhibit titled "Management Antifraud Programs and Controls" [paragraph .86] at the end of this section.
	</li>
	<li>
		For an entity with multiple locations, (a) the nature and extent of monitoring of operating locations or business segments, and (b) whether there are particular operating locations or business segments for which a risk of fraud may be more likely to exist
	</li>
	<li>
		Whether and how management communicates to employees its views on business practices and ethical behavior
	</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.21 </b>The inquiries of management also should include whether management has reported to those charged with governance [fn 11] on how the entity's internal control fn 12 serves to prevent, deter, or detect material misstatements due to fraud. [Revised, April 2007, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 114.]
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">22 </b>The inquiries of management also should include whether management has reported to those charged with governance [fn 11] on how the entity's internal control fn 12 serves to prevent, deter, or detect material misstatements due to fraud. [Revised, April 2007, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 114.]
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">23 </b>For entities that have an internal audit function, the auditor also should inquire of appropriate internal audit personnel about their views about the risks of fraud, whether they have performed any procedures to identify or detect fraud during the year, whether management has satisfactorily responded to any findings resulting from these procedures, and whether the internal auditors have knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud.
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">24 </b>In addition to the inquiries outlined in paragraphs .20 through .23, the auditor should inquire of others within the entity about the existence or suspicion of fraud. The auditor should use professional judgment to determine those others within the entity to whom inquiries should be directed and the extent of such inquiries. In making this determination, the auditor should consider whether others within the entity may be able to provide information that will be helpful to the auditor in identifying risks of material misstatement due to fraudâ€”for example, others who may have additional knowledge about or be able to corroborate risks of fraud identified in the discussions with management (see paragraph .20) or those charged with governance (see paragraph .22). [Revised, April 2007, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 114.]
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25 </b>Examples of others within the entity to whom the auditor may wish to direct these inquiries include:
<ul>
	<li>
		Employees with varying levels of authority within the entity, including, for example, entity personnel with whom the auditor comes into contact during the course of the audit in obtaining (a) an understanding of the entity's systems and internal control, (b) in observing inventory or performing cutoff procedures, or (c) in obtaining explanations for fluctuations noted as a result of analytical procedures
	</li>
	<li>
		Operating personnel not directly involved in the financial reporting process
	</li>
	<li>
		Employees involved in initiating, recording, or processing complex or unusual transactionsâ€”for example, a sales transaction with multiple elements, or a significant related party transaction
	</li>
	<li>
		In-house legal counsel
	</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.26 </b>The auditor's inquiries of management and others within the entity are important because fraud often is uncovered through information received in response to inquiries. One reason for this is that such inquiries may provide individuals with an opportunity to convey information to the auditor that otherwise might not be communicated. Making inquiries of others within the entity, in addition to management, may be useful in providing the auditor with a perspective that is different from that of individuals involved in the financial reporting process. The responses to these other inquiries might serve to corroborate responses received from management, or alternatively, might provide information regarding the possibility of management override of controlsâ€”for example, a response from an employee indicating an unusual change in the way transactions have been processed. In addition, the auditor may obtain information from these inquiries regarding how effectively management has communicated standards of ethical behavior to individuals throughout the organization.
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.27 </b>The auditor should be aware when evaluating management's responses to the inquiries discussed in paragraph .20 that management is often in the best position to perpetrate fraud. The auditor should use professional judgment in deciding when it is necessary to corroborate responses to inquiries with other information. However, when responses are inconsistent among inquiries, the auditor should obtain additional audit evidence to resolve the inconsistencies.
