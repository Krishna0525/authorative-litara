<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc53001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section applies when the auditor has decided to use audit sampling in performing audit procedures. It addresses the auditor's use of statistical and nonstatistical sampling when designing and selecting the audit sample, performing tests of controls and tests of details, and evaluating the results from the sample.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc53002">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>This section complements section 500, Audit Evidence, which addresses the auditor's responsibility to design and perform audit procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to be able to draw reasonable conclusions as a basis for forming the auditor???s opinion. Section 330, Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained, provides guidance on the means available to the auditor for selecting items for testing, one of which is audit sampling.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 1</sup>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objective</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc53004">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04  </b>The objective of the auditor, when using audit sampling, is to provide a reasonable basis for the auditor to draw conclusions about the population from which the sample is selected.
</div>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definitions</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc53005">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05  </b>For purposes of generally accepted auditing standards, the following terms have the meanings attributed as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Audit sampling (sampling).  </b>The selection and evaluation of less than 100 percent of the population of audit relevance such that the auditor expects the items selected (the sample) to be representative of the population and, thus, likely to provide a reasonable basis for conclusions about the population. In this context, representative means that evaluation of the sample will result in conclusions that, subject to the limitations of sampling risk, are similar to those that would be drawn if the same procedures were applied to the entire population. 
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nonsampling risk.  </b>The risk that the auditor reaches an erroneous conclusion for any reason not related to sampling risk.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population.  </b>The entire set of data from which a sample is selected and about which the auditor wishes to draw conclusions.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling risk.  </b>The risk that the auditor???s conclusion based on a sample may be different from the conclusion if the entire population were subjected to the same audit procedure. Sampling risk can lead to two types of erroneous conclusions:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.  </i>In the case of a test of controls, that controls are more effective than they actually are, or in the case of a test of details, that a material misstatement does not exist when, in fact, it does. The auditor is primarily concerned with this type of erroneous conclusion because it affects audit effectiveness and is more likely to lead to an inappropriate audit opinion.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.  </i>In the case of a test of controls, that controls are less effective than they actually are, or in the case of a test of details, that a material misstatement exists when, in fact, it does not. This type of erroneous conclusion affects audit efficiency because it would usually lead to additional work to establish that initial conclusions were incorrect.
</div>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling unit.  </b>The individual items constituting a population.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical sampling.  </b>An approach to sampling that has the following characteristics:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.  </i>Random selection of the sample items
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.  </i>The use of an appropriate statistical technique to evaluate sample results, including measurement of sampling risk
</div>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">A sampling approach that does not have characteristics a and b is considered nonstatistical sampling.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stratification.  </b>The process of dividing a population into subpopulations, each of which is a group of sampling units that have similar characteristics.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tolerable misstatement.  </b>A monetary amount set by the auditor in respect of which the auditor seeks to obtain an appropriate level of assurance that the monetary amount set by the auditor is not exceeded by the actual misstatement in the population.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tolerable rate of deviation.  </b>A rate of deviation set by the auditor in respect of which the auditor seeks to obtain an appropriate level of assurance that the rate of deviation set by the auditor is not exceeded by the actual rate of deviation in the population.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc53006">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06  </b>When designing an audit sample, the auditor should consider the purpose of the audit procedure and the characteristics of the population from which the sample will be drawn.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc53007">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07  </b>The auditor should determine a sample size sufficient to reduce sampling risk to an acceptably low level.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc53008">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08  </b>The auditor should select items for the sample in such a way that the auditor can reasonably expect the sample to be representative of the relevant population and likely to provide the auditor with a reasonable basis for conclusions about the population.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc53009">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09  </b>The auditor should perform audit procedures, appropriate to the purpose, on each item selected.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.10  </b>If the audit procedure is not applicable to the selected item, the auditor should perform the procedure on a replacement item.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11  </b>If the auditor is unable to apply the designed audit procedures, or suitable alternative procedures, to a selected item, the auditor should treat that item as a deviation from the prescribed control (in the case of tests of controls) or a misstatement (in the case of tests of details).

</b>  This section has been codified using an "AU-C" identifier instead of an "AU" identifier. "AU-C" is a temporary identifier to avoid confusion with references to existing "AU" sections, which will remain in AICPA Professional Standards through 2013. The "AU-C" identifier will revert to "AU" in 2014, by which time substantially all engagements for which the "AU" sections were still effective are expected to be completed.
