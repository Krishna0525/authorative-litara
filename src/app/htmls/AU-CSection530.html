				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A7</b> Audit sampling enables the auditor to obtain and evaluate audit evidence
				about some characteristic of the items selected in order to form or assist

				sampling approaches.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A8</b> When designing an audit sample, the auditor's consideration includes
				the specific purpose to be achieved and the combination of audit procedures
				that is likely to achieve that purpose. Consideration of the nature of the audit
				evidence sought and possible deviation or misstatement conditions or other
				characteristics relating to that audit evidence will assist the auditor in defining
				what constitutes a deviation or misstatement and what population to use for
				sampling. In fulfilling the requirement in section 500 when performing audit
				sampling, the auditor is required to perform audit procedures to obtain evidence
				that the population from which the audit sample is drawn is complete.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3</sup></p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A9</b> The auditor's consideration of the purpose of the audit procedure, as
				required by paragraph .06, includes a clear understanding of what constitutes
				a deviation or misstatement so that all, and only, those conditions that are relevant
				to the assertions are included in the evaluation of deviations or projection
				of misstatements. For example, in a test of details relating to the existence of
				accounts receivable, such as confirmation, payments made by the customer before
				the confirmation date but received shortly after that date by the client are
				not considered a misstatement. Also, an incorrect posting between customer accounts
				does not affect the total accounts receivable balance. Therefore, it may
				not be appropriate to consider this a misstatement in relation to the relevant
				assertion even though it may have an important effect on other areas of the audit,
				such as the assessment of the risk of fraud or the adequacy of the allowance
				for doubtful accounts.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A10</b> In considering the test objective and characteristics of a population
				for tests of controls, the auditor makes an assessment of the expected rate of
				deviation based on the auditor's understanding of the relevant controls. This
				assessment is made in order to design an audit sample and determine sample
				size. For example, if the expected rate of deviation is unacceptably high, the
				auditor will normally decide not to perform tests of controls. Similarly, for tests
				of details, the auditor makes an assessment of the expected misstatement in
				the population. If the expected misstatement is high, 100 percent examination
				or increasing the sample size may be appropriate when performing tests of
				details.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A11</b> In considering the characteristics of the population from which the

				greater the sample size necessary.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A13</b> The sample size can be determined by the application of a statistically

				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A14</b> The decision whether to use a statistical or nonstatistical sampling
				approach is a matter for the auditor's professional judgment; however, sample
				size is not a valid criterion to use in deciding between statistical and nonstatistical
				approaches. An auditor who applies statistical sampling may use tables
				or formulas to compute sample size based on the factors in paragraph .A13. An
				auditor who applies nonstatistical sampling exercises professional judgment to
				relate the same factors used in statistical sampling in determining the appropriate
				sample size. Ordinarily, this would result in a sample size comparable
				with the sample size resulting from an efficient and effectively designed statistical
				sample, considering the same sampling parameters. This guidance does
				not suggest that the auditor using nonstatistical sampling also compute a corresponding
				sample size using an appropriate statistical technique.</p>

			<ul style="list-style-type:none">
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A15</b> Audit sampling involves selection techniques that are probabilistic
				in nature. For example, through the assessment of the risk of material misstatement,
				an auditor might identify areas in which misstatement is relatively
				likely. The auditor might first separately examine those items deemed to be
				of relatively high risk and then use audit sampling (which will involve some
				form of probabilistic selection) to form an estimate of some characteristic of the
				remaining population.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A16</b> Random selection techniques include the following:</p>
					<ol type="a">

				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A17</b> With statistical sampling, sample items are selected using random
				selection techniques. The principal techniques of selecting a nonstatistical sample
				are the use of random selection and haphazard selection to select sample
				items.</p>

			<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Performing Audit Procedures</b></p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:none">
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A18</b> An example of when it is necessary to perform the procedure on a
				replacement item is when a voided check is selected while testing for evidence
				of payment authorization. If the auditor is satisfied that the check has been
				properly voided such that it does not constitute a deviation, an appropriately
				chosen replacement is examined.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A19</b> In some circumstances, the auditor may not be able to apply the
				planned audit procedures to selected sample items because, for example, the entity
				might not be able to locate supporting documentation. The auditor's treatment
				of unexamined items will depend on their effect on the auditor's evaluation
				of the sample. If the auditor's evaluation of the sample results would not
				be altered by considering those unexamined items to be misstated, it may not
				be necessary to examine the items, for example, if the aggregate amount of the
				unexamined items, if treated as misstatements or deviations, would not cause
				the auditor's assessment of the amount of the misstatement or deviation in
				the population to exceed tolerable misstatement or tolerable deviation, respectively.
				However, when this is not the case, the auditor is required by paragraph
				.11 to perform alternative procedures that provide sufficient appropriate audit
				evidence to form a conclusion about the sample item and use the results of these
				procedures in assessing the sample results. If alternative procedures cannot be
				satisfactorily performed in these cases, the auditor is required to treat the items
				as misstatements or deviations, as appropriate, in evaluating the results of the
				sample. Section 240, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit</i>,
				also requires the auditor to consider whether the reasons for the auditor's inability

				explains that the auditor may request management to examine a class of transactions,
				account balance, or disclosure in order for management to understand
				the cause of a misstatement identified by the auditor; perform procedures to
				determine the amount of the actual misstatement in the class of transactions,
				account balance, or disclosure; and make appropriate adjustments to the financial
				statements.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sup></p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A22</b> In analyzing the deviations and misstatements identified, the auditor
				may observe that many have a common feature (for example, type of transaction,
				location, product line, or period of time). In such circumstances, the auditor
				may decide to identify all items in the population that possess the common feature
				and extend audit procedures to those items. In addition, such deviations
				or misstatements may be intentional and may indicate the possibility of fraud.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A23</b> In addition to the evaluation of the frequency and amounts of monetary
				misstatements, section 450 requires the auditor to consider the qualitative
				aspects of the misstatements.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5</sup> These include (a) the nature and cause of misstatements,
				such as whether they are differences in principle or application, are
				errors, or are caused by fraud or are due to misunderstanding of instructions
				or carelessness, and (b) the possible relationship of the misstatements to other
				phases of the audit. The discovery of fraud requires a broader consideration of
				possible implications than does the discovery of an error.</p>

			<ul style="list-style-type:none">
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A24</b> For tests of details, the auditor is required by paragraph .13 to project
				misstatements observed in an audit sample to the population in order to obtain
				a likely misstatement. Due to sampling risk, this projection may not be sufficient
				to determine an amount to be recorded.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A25</b> For tests of controls, the sample deviation rate is also the projected
				deviation rate for the population as a whole. Section 330 addresses the auditor's
				response when deviations from controls upon which the auditor intends to rely
				are detected.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6</sup></p>

			<ul style="list-style-type:none">
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A26</b> For tests of controls, an unexpectedly high sample deviation rate may
				lead to an increase in the assessed risks of material misstatement, unless further
				audit evidence substantiating the initial assessment is obtained. For tests
				of details, an unexpectedly high misstatement amount in a sample may cause
				the auditor to believe that a class of transactions or account balance is materially
				misstated, in the absence of further audit evidence that no material
				misstatement exists.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A27</b> Considering the results of other audit procedures helps the auditor
				assess the risk that actual misstatement in the population exceeds tolerable
				misstatement; such risk may be reduced if additional audit evidence is obtained.
				In the case of tests of details, the <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">projected misstatement</i> is the auditor's
				best estimate of misstatement in the population. As the projected misstatement
				approaches or exceeds tolerable misstatement, the more likely that
				actual misstatement in the population exceeds tolerable misstatement. Also, if
				the projected misstatement is greater than the auditor's expectations of misstatement
				used to determine the sample size, the auditor may conclude that
				there is an unacceptable sampling risk that the actual misstatement in the
				population exceeds the tolerable misstatement. The AICPA Audit Guide <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Audit
				Sampling</i> contains further guidance regarding the concept of sampling risk.</p>

				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A28</b> If the auditor concludes that audit sampling has not provided a reasonable
				basis for conclusions about the population that has been tested, the
				auditor may</p>
					<ul>
