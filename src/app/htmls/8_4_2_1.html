<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Other Presentation Matters Section provides guidance on other presentation matters not addressed in the Recognition, Initial Measurement, Subsequent Measurement, and Derecognition Sections. Other presentation matters may include items such as current or long-term balance sheet classification, cash flow presentation, earnings per share matters, and so forth. The FASB Codification also contains Presentation Topics, which provide guidance for general presentation and display items. See those Topics for general guidance.

</p><p id="fasb83045">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-30-45-1   </b>The guidance in this Section discusses how a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">reporting entity</b> translates <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">foreign currency statements</b> and analyzes changes in the cumulative translation adjustment. It also addresses two related reporting matters. The guidance is organized as follows: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Translation of foreign currency statements 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Analysis of changes in cumulative translation adjustment 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Reporting other comprehensive incomeâ€”income tax consequences of rate changes 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Transaction gains and losses not extraordinary.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Translation of Foreign Currency Statements </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-30-45-2   </b>This guidance on translation of foreign currency statements is organized as follows: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Translation</b> using current <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">exchange rate</b> 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Elimination of intra-entity profits 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Translation after a business combination 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Reporting <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">translation adjustments</b> 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  Subsequent change in exchange rate 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.  Cumulative translation adjustments attributable to <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">noncontrolling interests</b>. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Translation Using Current Exchange Rate </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-30-45-3   </b>All elements of financial statements shall be translated by using a current exchange rate as follows: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  For assets and liabilities, the exchange rate at the balance sheet date shall be used. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  For revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, the exchange rate at the dates on which those elements are recognized shall be used. 
</p>
</p><p>This guidance also applies to accounting allocations (for example, depreciation, cost of sales, and amortization of deferred revenues and expenses) and requires translation at the current exchange rates applicable to the dates those allocations are included in revenues and expenses (that is, not the rates on the dates the related items originated). 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-30-45-4   </b>For purposes of translation of financial statements referred to in this Subtopic, the current exchange rate is the rate as of the end of the period covered by the financial statements or as of the dates of recognition in those statements in the case of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-30-45-5   </b>Paragraphs 830-10-55-10 through 55-11 address the use of averages or other methods of approximation.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;&gt; Exchange Rates </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-30-45-6   </b>In the absence of unusual circumstances, the exchange rate applicable to conversion of a currency for purposes of dividend remittances shall be used to translate foreign currency statements. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-30-45-7   </b>If unsettled intra-entity transactions are subject to and translated using preference or penalty rates, translation of foreign currency statements at the rate applicable to dividend remittances may cause a difference between intra-entity receivables and payables. Until that difference is eliminated by settlement of the intra-entity transaction, the difference shall be treated as a receivable or payable in the reporting entity's financial statements. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-30-45-8   </b>If a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">foreign entity</b> whose balance sheet date differs from that of the reporting entity is consolidated or combined with or accounted for by the equity method in the financial statements of the reporting entity, the current rate is the rate in effect at the foreign entity's balance sheet date for purposes of applying the requirements of this Subtopic to that foreign entity. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-30-45-9   </b>If exchangeability between two currencies is temporarily lacking at the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">transaction date</b> or balance sheet date, the first subsequent rate at which exchanges could be made shall be used for purposes of this Subtopic. If the lack of exchangeability is other than temporary, the propriety of consolidating, combining, or accounting for the foreign operation by the equity method in the financial statements of the reporting entity shall be carefully considered. Example 1 (see paragraph 830-30-55-1 ) illustrates the application of this paragraph.
