<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">805-10-25-1   An entity shall determine whether a transaction or other event is a business combination by applying the definition in this Subtopic, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. If the assets acquired are not a business, the reporting entity shall account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. An entity shall account for each business combination by applying the acquisition method. </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">805-10-25-2   </b>Paragraph 805-10-05-4 summarizes the four steps in the acquisition method. This Section establishes the requirements for the following two of the four steps: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	a.  Identifying the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">acquirer</b> 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	b.  Identifying the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">acquisition date</b>. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">805-10-25-3   </b>This Section also provides guidance on all of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Particular types of business combinations 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The measurement period 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Determining what is part of the business combination transaction. 
</p>
</p><p></p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Determining What Is Part of the Business Combination Transaction </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">805-10-25-20   The acquirer and the acquiree may have a preexisting relationship or other arrangement before negotiations for the business combination began, or they may enter into an arrangement during the negotiations that is separate from the business combination. In either situation, the acquirer shall identify any amounts that are not part of what the acquirer and the acquiree (or its former owners) exchanged in the business combination, that is, amounts that are not part of the exchange for the acquiree. The acquirer shall recognize as part of applying the acquisition method only the consideration transferred for the acquiree and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the exchange for the acquiree. Separate transactions shall be accounted for in accordance with the relevant generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">805-10-25-21   </b>A transaction entered into by or on behalf of the acquirer or primarily for the benefit of the acquirer or the combined entity, rather than primarily for the benefit of the acquiree (or its former owners) before the combination, is likely to be a separate transaction. The following are examples of separate transactions that are not to be included in applying the acquisition method: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  A transaction that in effect settles preexisting relationships between the acquirer and acquiree (see paragraphs 805-10-55-20 through 55-23) 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  A transaction that compensates employees or former owners of the acquiree for future services (see paragraphs 805-10-55-24 through 55-26) 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  A transaction that reimburses the acquiree or its former owners for paying the acquirer's acquisition-related costs (see paragraph 805-10-25-23). 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Acquisition-Related Costs </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">805-10-25-23   </b>Acquisition-related costs are costs the acquirer incurs to effect a business combination. Those costs include finder's fees; advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees; general administrative costs, including the costs of maintaining an internal acquisitions department; and costs of registering and issuing debt and equity securities. The acquirer shall account for acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received, with one exception. The costs to issue debt or equity securities shall be recognized in accordance with other applicable GAAP.
