<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Recognition Section provides guidance on the required criteria, timing, and location (within the financial statements) for recording a particular item in the financial statements. Disclosure is not recognition. </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note for Fair Value Option: </b>Some of the items subject to the guidance in this Subtopic may qualify for application of the Fair Value Option Subsections of Subtopic 825-10. Those Subsections (see paragraph 825-10-05-5) address circumstances in which entities may choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the fair value option). See Section 825-10-15 for guidance on the scope of the Fair Value Option Subsections of the Financial Instruments Topic. </p><p>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Background for Recognition </b>
</p><p id="fasb4102025">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-1   </b>Paragraph 35 of FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, defines a liability as follows {Note: The indented text below is reproduced from FASB Concepts Statement No. 6 and includes editorial changes for internal consistency within the Codification}. 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	Liabilities are probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-2   </b>Probable is used with its usual general meaning, rather than in a specific accounting or technical sense (such as that in paragraph 450-20-25-1), and refers to that which can reasonably be expected or believed on the basis of available evidence or logic but is neither certain nor proved (Webster's New World Dictionary). Its inclusion in the definition is intended to acknowledge that business and other economic activities occur in an environment characterized by uncertainty in which few outcomes are certain (see paragraphs 44 through 48 of FASB Concepts Statement No. 6). 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-3   </b>As stated in the preceding paragraph, the definition of a liability in Concepts Statement 6 uses the term probable in a different sense than it is used in paragraph 450-20-25-1. As used in Topic 450, probable requires a high degree of expectation. The term probable in the definition of a liability, however, is intended to acknowledge that business and other economic activities occur in an environment in which few outcomes are certain. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-3A   </b>Paragraph 410-20-40-3 states that providing assurance that an entity will be able to satisfy its asset retirement obligation does not satisfy or extinguish the related liability.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Fair Value Is Reasonably Estimated </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-4   </b>An entity shall recognize the fair value of a liability for an <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">asset retirement obligation</b> in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability shall be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a tangible long-lived asset with an existing asset retirement obligation is acquired, a liability for that obligation shall be recognized at the asset's acquisition date as if that obligation were incurred on that date. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-5   </b>Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an entity shall capitalize an <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">asset retirement cost</b> by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Paragraph 835-20-30-5 explains that capitalized asset retirement costs do not qualify as expenditures for purposes of applying Subtopic 835-20.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-6   </b>An entity shall identify all its asset retirement obligations. An entity has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation if any of the following conditions exist: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  It is evident that the fair value of the obligation is embodied in the acquisition price of the asset. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  An active market exists for the transfer of the obligation. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Sufficient information exists to apply an expected present value technique. </p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Obligations with Uncertainty in Timing or Method of Settlement </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-7   </b>The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Thus, the timing and (or) method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. Accordingly, an entity shall recognize a liability for the fair value of a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">conditional asset retirement obligation</b> if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. In some cases, sufficient information about the timing and (or) method of settlement may not be available to reasonably estimate fair value. An expected present value technique incorporates uncertainty about the timing and method of settlement into the fair value measurement. Uncertainty is factored into the measurement of the fair value of the liability through assignment of probabilities to cash flows. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-8   </b>An entity would have sufficient information to apply an expected present value technique and therefore an asset retirement obligation would be reasonably estimable if either of the following conditions exists: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The settlement date and method of settlement for the obligation have been specified by others. For example, the law, regulation, or contract that gives rise to the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">legal obligation</b> specifies the settlement date and method of settlement. In this situation, the settlement date and method of settlement are known and therefore the only uncertainty is whether the obligation will be enforced (that is, whether performance will be required). In certain cases, determining the settlement date for the obligation that has been specified by others is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. For example, a contract that provides the entity with an ability to extend its term through renewal should be evaluated to determine whether the settlement date should take into consideration renewal periods. Uncertainty about whether performance will be required does not defer the recognition of an asset retirement obligation because a legal obligation to stand ready to perform the retirement activities still exists, and it does not prevent the determination of a reasonable estimate of fair value because the only uncertainty is whether performance will be required. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The information is available to reasonably estimate all of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1.  The settlement date or the range of potential settlement dates 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2.  The method of settlement or potential methods of settlement (The term <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">potential methods of settlement</i> refers to methods of settling the obligation that are currently available to the entity. Therefore, uncertainty about future methods yet to be developed would not prevent the entity from estimating the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.) 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">3.  The probabilities associated with the potential settlement dates and potential methods of settlement. (The entity should have a reasonable basis for assigning probabilities to the potential settlement dates and potential methods of settlement to reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. If the entity does not have a reasonable basis of assigning probabilities, it is expected that the entity would still be able to reasonably estimate fair value when the range of time over which the entity may settle the obligation is so narrow and (or) the cash flows associated with each potential method of settlement are so similar that assigning probabilities without having a reasonable basis for doing so would not have a material impact on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.) 
</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-9   </b>In many cases, the determination as to whether the entity has the information to reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. It is expected that the narrower the range of time over which the entity may settle the obligation and the fewer potential methods of settlement the entity has available to it, the more likely it is that the entity will have the information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. For an illustration of this guidance, see Example 3 (paragraph 410-20-55-47). 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-10   </b>Instances may occur in which insufficient information to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation is available. For example, if an asset has an indeterminate useful life, sufficient information to estimate a range of potential settlement dates for the obligation might not be available. In such cases, the liability would be initially recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to estimate a range of potential settlement dates that is needed to employ a present value technique to estimate fair value. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-11   </b>Examples of information that is expected to provide a basis for estimating the potential settlement dates, potential methods of settlement, and the associated probabilities include, but are not limited to, information that is derived from the entity's past practice, industry practice, management's intent, or the asset's estimated economic life. The estimated economic life of the asset might indicate a potential settlement date for the asset retirement obligation. However, the original estimated economic life of the asset may not, in and of itself, establish that date because the entity may intend to make improvements to the asset that could extend the life of the asset or the entity could defer settlement of the obligation beyond the economic life of the asset. In those situations, the entity would look beyond the economic life of the asset in determining the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates to use when estimating the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-12   </b>An asset retirement obligation may result from the acquisition, construction, or development and (or) normal operation of a long-lived asset that has an indeterminate useful life and thereby an indeterminate settlement date for the asset retirement obligation. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20-25-13   </b>If a current law, regulation, or contract requires an entity to perform an asset retirement activity when an asset is dismantled or demolished, there is an unambiguous requirement to perform the retirement activity even if that activity can be indefinitely deferred. At some time deferral will no longer be possible, because no tangible asset will last forever (except land). Therefore, the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement.
