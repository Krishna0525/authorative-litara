45-1</b> This Subtopic specifies certain basic information to be reported in financial statements of not-for-
profit entities (NFPs). The requirements generally are no more stringent than requirements for business
entities. The degree of aggregation and order of presentation of items of assets and liabilities in
statements of financial position or of items of revenues and expenses in statements of activities of NFPs,
although not specified, generally should be similar to those required or permitted for business entities.
Particular formats for a statement of financial position, a statement of activities, or a statement of cash
flows, are neither prescribed nor prohibited in part because similar prescriptions and proscriptions do
not exist for business entities.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
45-2</b> The usefulness of information provided by financial statements of NFPs can be vastly improved if
certain basic information is classified in comparable ways. NFPs shall do the following</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
a.</b> Report assets and liabilities in reasonably homogeneous groups and sequence or classify them in ways
that provide relevant information about their interrelationships, liquidity, and financial flexibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.</b> Classify and report net assets in two groups—net assets with donor restrictions and net assets
without donor restrictions—based on the existence or absence of {add glossary link} donor-imposed
restrictions{add glossary link}. Information about restrictions imposed by donors on the use of
contributed assets, including their potential effects on specific assets and on liabilities or classes of net
assets, shall be disclosed in accordance with paragraph 958-210- 50-3, because it is helpful in assessing
the financial flexibility of an NFP.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

c.</b> Aggregate items of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses into reasonably homogeneous groups and
classify and report them as increases or decreases in net assets with donor restrictions or net assets
without donor restrictions</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d.</b> Classify and report cash receipts and cash payments as resulting from investing, financing, or
operating activities.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-3</b> Reporting by fund groups is not a necessary part of external financial reporting; however, this
Subtopic does not preclude providing disaggregated information by fund groups.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Complete Set of Financial Statements</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4</b> A complete set of financial statements of an NFP shall include a statement of financial position as
of the end of the reporting period, a statement of activities and a statement of cash flows for the
reporting period, and accompanying notes to financial statements.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-5</b> A set of financial statements shall include, either in the body of financial statements or in the

accompanying notes, information required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) required
by applicable specialized accounting and reporting principles and practices unless NFPs are specifically
exempt from providing that information.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reporting of Expenses by Nature and Function</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

45-6</b> Reporting expenses by nature and function is useful in associating expenses with service efforts
and accomplishments of NFPs. All NFPs shall report information about all expenses in one location—on
the face of the statement of activities, as a schedule in the notes to financial statements, or in a
separate financial statement—as required by paragraph 958-720- 45-15. The relationship between
functional classification and natural classification for all expenses shall be presented in an analysis that
disaggregates functional expense classifications, such as major classes of program services and
supporting activities, a by their natural expense classifications, such as salaries, rent, electricity, supplies,
interest expense, depreciation, awards and grants to others, and professional fees. To the extent that
expenses are reported by other than their natural classification (such as salaries included in cost of
goods sold or facility rental costs of special events reported as direct benefits to donors), they shall be
reported by their natural classification in the functional expense analysis. For example, salaries, wages,
and fringe benefits that are included as part of the cost of goods sold on the statement of activities shall
be included with other salaries, wages, and fringe benefits in the expense analysis. External and direct
internal investment expenses that have been netted against investment return shall not be included in
the functional expense analysis. Certain items that are typically reported in other comprehensive
income of for-profit entities, such as those items listed in paragraph 220-10- 45-10A, are considered
gains or losses and, like other gains and losses, shall not be included in the functional expense analysis.
See Note F in paragraph 958-205- 55-21 for an example that illustrates the reporting of expenses by
nature and function.</p>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Expirations of Donor-Imposed Restrictions</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-9</b> An NFP shall recognize the expiration of a donor-imposed restriction on a contribution in the period
in which the restriction expires. A restriction expires when the stipulated time has elapsed, when the
stipulated purpose for which the resource was restricted has been fulfilled, or both. If two or more
donor-imposed restrictions that are temporary in nature are imposed on a contribution, the effect of
the expiration of those restrictions shall be recognized in the period in which the last remaining
restriction has expired.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-10</b> For example, a gift of a term endowment that is to be invested for five years has two donor-
imposed restrictions that are temporary in nature—a purpose restriction (to be invested) and a time
restriction (for a period of five years). After five years of investing, the purpose restriction will be met
and the time restriction will lapse. In Year 5, when that term endowment no longer donor-restricted, a
reclassification of net assets shall be reported to reflect the decrease in net assets with donor
restrictions and the increase in net assets without donor restrictions.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-left: 10px;">
45-10A In determining when the last of two or more donor imposed restrictions that are temporary in
nature has expired, explicit donor stipulations generally carry more weight than implied restrictions. For
example, assume in Year 1 that an entity receives an unconditional promise to give that is payable in
two equal installments in Years 2 and 3 with an explicit donor stipulation that its gift is to cover
purchases of new equipment for the new School of Chemistry, which is expected to be completed in
Year 3. That gift would have a purpose restriction (to be used to acquire new equipment to be housed in
the new building), and because the unconditional promise is payable in Years 2 and 3, an entity
generally would imply a time restriction (see paragraph 958-605- 45-5). If, however, the building was
completed early and opened in Year 2 and all of the needed equipment was purchased in Year 2 and
exceeded the promised amount, absent an explicit stipulation to the contrary, it would be reasonable to
conclude that those purchases fulfilled the donor restriction on the promised gift.The restriction for the
purchase of the equipment expires when the equipment is placed in service in accordance with
paragraph 958-205- 45-12. In addition, a reclassification of net assets would be reported to reflect the
decrease in net assets with donor restrictions and the increase in net assets without donor restrictions
in Year 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-11</b> If an expense is incurred for a purpose for which both net assets without donor restrictions and
net assets with donor restrictions are available, a donor-imposed restriction is fulfilled to the extent of
the expense incurred unless the expense is for a purpose that is directly attributable to another specific
external source of revenue. For example, an expense does not fulfill an existing donor restriction if that
expense is incurred for a purpose that is directly attributable to and reimbursed by a sponsored
exchange agreement or a conditional award from a government agency, private foundation, or others.
Explicit time restrictions, such as those discussed in paragraph 958-205- 45-10, and implied time
restrictions, such as those discussed in paragraph 958- 605-45- 5, make net assets unavailable to support
expenses until the time restrictions have expired.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
45-12</b> Unless donor stipulations limit the use of the assets for a period of time or for a particular
purpose, donor restrictions on long-lived assets, if any, or cash to acquire or construct long-lived assets
are considered to have expired when the assets are placed in service.</p>
