<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25 Recognition</b>
</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Recognition Section provides guidance on the required criteria, timing, and location (within the financial statements) for recording a particular item in the financial statements.  Disclosure is not recognition.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Short Duration Contracts</b>
</p><p id="94425">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-1</b>  Premiums from short-duration contracts shall be recognized as revenue over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided.  for those few types of contracts for which the period of risk differs significantly form the contract period,premiums shall be recognized as revenue over the period of risk in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided.  That generally results in premiums being recognized as revenue evenly over the contract period (or the period of risk, if different), except for those few cases in which the amount of insurance [protection declines according to a predetermined schedule.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-2</b>  If premiums are subject to adjustment (for example, retrospectively rated or other experience-rated insurance contracts for which the premium is determined after the period of the contract based on claim experience or reporting-form contracts for which the premium is adjusted after the period of the contract based on the value pf insured property), premium revenue shall be recognized as follows:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    If the ultimate premium is reasonably estimable, the estimated ultimate premium shall be recognized as revenue over the period of the  contract.  The estimated ultimate premium shall be revised to reflect current experience.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  If the ultimate premium cannot be reasonably estimated, the cost recovery method or the deposit method may be used until the ultimate premium becomes reasonably estimable.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-Duration Contracts</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-3</b>  Because no single function or service is predominant over the periods of most types of long-duration contracts, premiums shall be recognized as revenue over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from policyholders.  This includes premiums form whole-life contracts, guaranteed renewable term life contracts, title insurance contracts, and participating life insurance contracts that meet the criteria in paragraph 944-20-15-3.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-4</b>  Premium revenue from long-duration contracts generally exceeds expected policy benefits in the early years of the contracts and it is necessary to accrue, as premium revenue is recognized, a liability for costs that are expected to be paid in the later years of the contracts.  See Subtopic 944-40 for specific guidance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Limited-Payment Contracts</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-4A</b>  Because the collection of premium under a limited-payment contract does not represent the completion of the earnings process, any gross premium received in excess of the net premium shall be deferred.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Universal Life-Type Contracts</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-5</b>  Premiums collected on universal life-type contracts shall not be reported as revenue int he statement of earnings of the insurance entity.  Revenue form those contracts shall represent amounts assessed against policyholders and shall be reported in the period that the amounts are assessed unless evidence indicates that the amounts are designed to compensate the insurer for services to be provided over more than one period.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-6</b>  Amounts assessed that represent compensation to the insurance entity for services to be provided in future periods are not earned in the period assessed.  Such amounts shall be recognized as unearned revenue.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-7</b>  Amounts that are assessed against the policyholder balance as consideration for origination of the contract, often referred to as initiation or front-end fees, shall be recognized as unearned revenues.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt; Contracts with Death or Other Insurance Benefit Features</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-8</b>  If the amounts assessed against the contract holder each period for the insurance benefit feature of an insurance contract are assessed in manner that is expected to result in profits in earlier years and losses in subsequent years from the insurance benefit function, a liability for unearned revenue shall be recognized in addition to the account balance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-9</b>  An insurance entity shall not record a liability for unearned revenue of the purpose is an attempt to on appropriately level the contract's gross profit over the life of the contract to the accrual would serve to produce  a level gross profit from the mortality benefit over the life of the contract.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-10</b>  This Subtopic does not limit the acfr5ual of unearned revenue for insurance benefit features of universal life-type contracts to situations where profits are expected to be followed by losses; that is, the facts and circumstances of each situation must be considered in determining the meed for accruing unearned revenue.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-11</b>  An increase during a period in an unearned revenue liability shall be excluded from the amounts assessed against the contract holder's account balance for that period and a decrease in an unearned revenue liability during a period shall be included with the assessments for that period.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Title Insurance Contracts</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-12</b>  Except as noted in the next sentence, premiums form title insurance contracts shall be considered due from policyholders and, accordingly, recognized as revenue on the effective date of the insurance contract because most of the services associated with the contract have been rendered by that time.  However, the binder date is appropriate if the insurance entity is legally or contractually entitled to the premium on the binder date.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-13</b>  If reasonably estimable, premium revenue and costs relating to title insurance contracts issued by agents shall be recognized when the agents are legally or contractually entitled to the premiums, using estimates based on past experience and other sources.  If not reasonably estimable, premium revenue and costs shall be recognized when agents report the issuance of title insurance contracts.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Retrospective and Contingent Commission Arrangements</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-14</b>  If retrospective commission or experience refund arrangements exist under experience-rated insurance contracts, a separate liability shall be accrued for those amounts.  Income in any period shall not include any amounts that are expected to be paid to agents or others in the form of experience refunds or additional commissions.  Contingent commissions receivable or payable shall be accrued over the period in which related income is recognized.

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt;  Periodic Method</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-16</b>  The periodic method and open year method are not interchangeable in the same circumstances.  The periodic method and open year method are not alternative accounting principles as discussed in Topic 250.  Rather, one or the other is to be used depending on the circumstances.  As such, changes between these methods are not accounting changes.  In addition, changes from the periodic method to the open year method would be seldom.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-17</b>  The periodic method or accounting for reinsurance provides for current recognition of profits and losses.  Premiums are recognized as revenue over the policy term, and claims, including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, are recognized as they occur.  the periodic method shall be used to account for foreign reinsurance except in the circumstances described int he following paragraph.  Only of reasonable estimates cannot be made currently, for the reason discussed in the following paragraph, shall the open year method be used.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt;  Open Year Method</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-18</b>  If, due to local revenue recognition policies, the foreign ceding entity cannot provide the information required by the assuming entity to estimate both the ultimate premiums and the appropriate periods of recognition in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), then the open year method shall be used.  If the foreign ceding entity maintains supplementary records that are sufficient to reasonably estimate earned premiums currently, then the U.S. assuming entity shall obtain the necessary information and use the periodic method to account for the foreign reinsurance.  The presence of uncertainties that may be inherent in estimating earned premiums is not an acceptable basis for using open year method.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-19</b>  Under the pen year method, premiums, claims, commissions, and related direct taxes shall not be reported currently as income; instead, paragraph 944-605-35-5 requires that they be included in the open underwriting balance to which they pertain.  the underwriting balances shall be aggregated and each underwriting balance shall be kept open until, as discussed in paragraph 944-605-35-6, sufficient information becomes available to record a reasonable estimate of earned premiums

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt;  Prospective Reinsurance</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-20</b>  Amounts paid for prospective reinsurance of short-duration contracts tat meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting shall be reported as prepaid reinsurance premiums.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt;  Distinguishing Prospective Provisions from Retroactive Provisions</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-21</b>  If practicable, prospective and retroactive provisions included within a single contract shall be accounted for separately.  The Reinsurance Contracts Subsections of this Subtopic do not require any specific method for allocating reinsurance premiums to the prospective and retroactive portions of a contract .  However, separate accounting for the prospective and retroactive portions of the contract may take place only when an allocation is practicable.  Practicability requires a reasonable basis for allocating the reinsurance premiums to the risks covered by the prospective and retroactive portions of the contract, considering all amounts paid or deemed to have been paid regardless of the timing of payment.  If separate accounting for prospective and retroactive provisions included within a single contract is impracticable, the contract shall be accounted for as a retroactive contract provided the conditions foe reinsurance accounting are met.  Impracticable is used in the sense used in paragraph 825-10-50-17 to mean that the prospective and retroactive provisions can be accounted foe separately without incurring excessive costs.
  </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt;  Retroactive Reinsurance</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-22</b>  Amounts paid for retroactive reinsurance of short-duration contracts that meets the conditions for reinsurance accounting shall be reported as reinsurance receivables to the extent those amounts do not exceed the recorded liabilities relating to the underlying reinsured contracts.  If the recorded liabilities exceed the amounts paid, reinsurance receivables shall be increased to reflect the difference and the resulting gain deferred.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-23</b>  If the amounts paid for retroactive reinsurance for short-duration contracts exceed the recorded liabilities relating to the underlying reinsured short-duration contracts, the ceding entity shall increase the related liabilities or reduce the reinsurance receivable or both at the same time the reinsurance contract is into, so that the excess is charged to earnings.
