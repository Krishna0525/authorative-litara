<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Recognition Section provides guidance on the required criteria, timing, and location (within the financial statements) for recording a particular item in the financial statements. Disclosure is not recognition.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note for Fair Value Option:</b>  Some of the items subject to the guidance in this Subtopic may qualify for application of the Fair Value Option Subsections of Subtopic 825-10. Those Subsections (see paragraph 825-10-05-5) address circumstances in which entities may choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the fair value option). See Section 825-10-15 for guidance on the scope of the Fair Value Option Subsections of the Financial Instruments Topic.

<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Contract Costs</p>
</p><p id="60525">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-34</b>  Contract costs are accumulated in the same manner as inventory costs and are charged to operations as the related revenue from contracts is recognized.  Contract costs generally include all direct costs, such as materials, direct labor, and subcontracts, and indirect costs identifiable with or allocable to the contracts.  However, practice varies for certain types of indirect costs considered allocable to contracts (for example, support costs such as central preparation and processing of job payrolls, billing and collection costs, and bidding and estimating costs).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-35</b>  Costs shall be considered period costs if they cannot be clearly related to production, either directly or by an allocation based on their discernible future benefits.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-36</b>  As noted elsewhere in the Subtopic, income is recognized over the term of the contract under the percentage-of-completion method or is recognized as units are delivered under the units-of-delivery modification, and is deferred until performance is substantially complete under the completed-contract method.  None of the characteristics peculiar to those methods, however, requires accounting for contract costs to deviate in principle from the basic accounting framework applicable to inventories or business entities in general.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-37</b>  A contracting entity shall apply the following general principles in accounting for costs of construction-type and those production-type contracts covered by this Subtopic.  The principles are consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for inventory and production costs in other areas, and their application requires the exercise of judgment.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  All direct costs, such as material, labor, and subcontracting costs, shall be included in contract costs.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Indirect costs allocable to contracts include the costs of indirect labor, contract supervision, tools and equipment, supplies, quality control and inspection, insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and, in some circumstances, support costs, such as central preparation and processing of payrolls.  Methods of allocating indirect costs should be systematic and rational.  They include, for example, allocations based on direct labor costs, direct labor hours, or a combination of direct labor and material costs.  The appropriateness of allocations of indirect costs and of the methods of allocation depend on the circumstances and involve judgment.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  General and administrative costs ordinarily shall be charged to expense as incurred but may be accounted for as contract costs under the completed-contract method of accounting as discusses in paragraph 605-35-25-99.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Selling costs shall be excluded from contract costs and charged to expense as incurred unless they meet the criteria for precontract costs in paragraph 605-35-25-41.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  Costs under cost-type contracts shall be charged to contract costs in conformity with GAAP in the same manner as costs under other types of contracts because unrealistic profit margins may result in circumstances in which reimbursable cost accumulations omit substantial contract costs (with a resulting larger fee) or include substantial unallocable general and administrative costs (with a resulting smaller fee).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.  In computing estimated gross profit or providing for losses on contracts, estimates of cost to complete shall reflect all of the types of costs included in contract costs.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">g.  Inventoriable costs shall not be carried at amounts that, when added to the estimated cost to complete, are greater than the estimated realizable value of the related contracts.
</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-38</b>  Interest costs shall be accounted for in accordance with Subtopic 835-20.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Precontract Costs</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-39</b>  Costs are deferred in anticipation of future contract sales in a variety of circumstances.  The costs may consist of any of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Costs incurred in anticipation of a specific contract that will result in no future benefit unless the contract is obtained (such as the cots of mobilization, engineering, architectural, or other services incurred on the basis of commitments or other indications of interest in negotiating a contract)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Costs incurred for assets to be used in connection with specific anticipated contracts (for example, costs for the purchase of production equipment, materials, or supplies)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Costs incurred to acquire or produce goods in excess of the amounts required under a contract in anticipation of future orders for the same item
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Learning, start-up, or mobilization costs incurred for anticipated but unidentified contracts.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-40</b>  Learning or start-up costs are sometimes incurred in connection with the performance of a contract or a group of contracts.  In some circumstances, follow-on or future contracts for the same goods or services are anticipated.  Such costs usually consist of labor, overhead, rework, or other special costs that must be incurred to complete the existing contract or contracts on progress and are distinguished from research and development costs.  (Section 730-10-25 requires that research and development costs be charged to expense when incurred.)  A direct relationship between such costs and the anticipated future contracts is often difficult to establish, and the receipt of future contracts often cannot reasonably be anticipated.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-41</b>  The following accounting is recommended for precontract costs:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Costs that are incurred for a specific anticipated contract and that will result in no future benefits unless the contract is obtained shall not be included in contract costs or inventory before the receipt of the contract.  However, such costs otherwise may be deferred, subject to evaluation of their probable recoverability, but only if the costs can be directly associated with a specific anticipated contract and if their recoverability from that contract is probable.  Precontract costs that are start-up activities shall be expensed as incurred if they are determined to be within the scope of Subtopic 720-15.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Costs incurred for assets, such as costs for the purchase of materials, production equipment, or supplies, that are expected to be used in connection with anticipated contracts may be deferred outside the contract cost or inventory classification if their recovery from future contract revenue or from other dispositions of the assets is probable.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Costs incurred to acquire or produce goods in excess of the amounts required for an existing contract in anticipation of future orders for the same items may be treated as inventory if their recovery is probable.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Learning or start-up costs incurred in connection with existing contracts and in anticipation of follow-on or future contracts for the same goods or services should be charged to existing contracts.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  Costs appropriately deferred in anticipation of a contract shall be included in contract costs on the receipt of the anticipated contract.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.  Costs related to anticipated contracts that are charged to expenses as incurred because their recovery is not considered probable shall not be reinstated by a credit to income on the subsequent receipt of the contract.
</p>
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Cost Adjustments Arising from Back Charges</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-42</b>  Back charges are billings for work performed or costs incurred by one party that, in accordance with the agreement, should have been performed or incurred by the party to whom billed.  These frequently are disputed items.  For example, owners bill back charges to general contractors, and general contractors bill back charges to subcontractors.  Examples of back charges include charges for cleanup work and charges for a subcontractor's use of a general contractor's equipment.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-43</b>  A common practice is to net back charges in the estimating process.  The following procedures are recommended in accounting for back charges:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Back charges to others shall be recorded as receivables and, to the extent considered collectible, shall be applied to reduce contract costs.  However, if the billed party disputes the propriety or amount of the charge, the back charge is in effect a claim, and the criteria for recording claims apply.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Back charges from others shall be recorded as payables and as additional contract costs to the extent that it is probable that the amounts will be paid.
</p>
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Estimated Costs to Complete</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-44</b>  The estimated cost to complete (the other component of total estimated contract cost) is a significant variable in the process of determining income earned and is thus a significant factor in accounting for contracts. The latest estimate may be determined in a variety of ways and may be the same as the original estimate. The following approaches should be followed:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Systematic and consistent procedures that are correlated with the cost accounting system should be used to provide a basis for periodically comparing actual and estimated costs.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. In estimating total contract costs, the quantities and prices of all significant elements of cost should be identified.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. The estimating procedures should provide that estimated cost to complete includes the same elements of cost that are included in actual accumulated costs. Also, those elements should reflect expected price increases.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. The effects of future wage and price escalations should be taken into account in cost estimates, especially when the contract performance will be carried out over a significant period of time.  Escalation provisions should not be blanket overall provisions but should cover labor, materials, and indirect costs based on percentages or amounts that take into consideration experience and other pertinent data.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e. Estimates of cost to complete should be reviewed periodically and revised as appropriate to reflect new information.
</p>
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Provisions for Losses on Contracts</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-45</b>  For a contract on which a loss is anticipated, GAAP requires recognition of the entire anticipated loss as soon as the loss becomes evident. An entity without the ability to update and revise estimates continually with a degree of confidence could not meet that essential requirement of GAAP.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-46</b>  When the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract shall be made. Provisions for losses shall be made in the period in which they become evident under either the percentage-of-completion method or the completed-contract method.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-47</b>  If a group of contracts are combined based on the criteria in paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">605-35-25-8 through 25-9</u>, they shall be treated as a unit in determining the necessity for a provision for a loss. If contracts are segmented based on the criteria in paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">605-35-25-12 through 25-14</u> the individual segments shall be considered separately in determining the need for a provision for a loss.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-48</b>  Losses on cost-type contracts, although less frequent, may arise if, for example, a contract provides for guaranteed maximum reimbursable costs or target penalties. In recognizing losses for accounting purposes, the contractor's normal cost accounting methods shall be used in determining the total cost overrun on the contract, and losses shall include provisions for performance penalties.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-49</b>  The costs used in arriving at the estimated loss on a contract shall include all costs of the type allocable to contracts under paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">605-35-25-37</u>. Other factors that should be considered in arriving at the projected loss on a contract include all of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Target penalties and rewards
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. Nonreimbursable costs on cost-plus contracts
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. Change orders
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. Potential price redeterminations.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-50</b>  In circumstances in which general and administrative expenses are treated as contract
costs under the completed-contract method of accounting, the estimated loss shall include the same
types of general and administrative expenses.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt;  Units-of-
Delivery Method</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-55</b>  The units-of-delivery is a modification of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for contracts.  The units-of-delivery method recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of a basic production product delivered during a period and as the cost of earned revenue the costs allocable to the delivery units; costs allocable to undelivered units are reported in the balance sheet as inventory or work in progress.  The method is used in circumstances in which an entity produces units of a basic product under production-type contracts in a  continuous or sequential production process to buyer's specifications.</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Circumstances Appropriate for Using the Percentage-of-Completion Method</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-56</b>  The use of the percentage-of-completion method depends on the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates, which, for purposes of this Subtopic, relates to estimates of the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues, and contract costs.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-57</b>  The percentage-of-completion method is considered preferable as an accounting policy in circumstances in which reasonably dependable estimates can be made and in which all the following conditions exist:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Contracts executed by the parties normally include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by the parties, the consideration to be exchanged, and the manner and terms of settlement.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The buyer can be expected to satisfy all obligations under the contract.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  The contractor can be expected to perform all contractual obligations.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-58</b>  For entities engaged on a continuing basis in the production and delivery of goods or services under the contractual arrangements and for whom contracting represents a significant part of their operations, the presumption is that they have the ability to make estimates that are sufficiently dependable to justify the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  Persuasive evidence to the contrary is necessary to overcome that presumption.  The ability to produce reasonably dependable estimates is an essential element of the contracting business.  Accordingly, entities with significant contracting operations generally have the ability to produce reasonably dependable estimates and for such entities the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is preferable in most circumstances.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-59</b>  Many contractors have informal estimating procedures that may result in poorly documented estimates and marginal quality field reporting and job costing systems.  Those conditions may influence the ability of an entity to produce reasonably dependable estimates.  However, procedures and systems should not influence the development of accounting principles.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-60</b>  The percentage-of-completion method shall be applied to individual contracts or profit centers, as appropriate, based on all of the following considerations:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Normally, a contractor will be able to estimate total contract revenue and total contract cost in single amounts.  Those amounts should normally be used as the basis for accounting for contracts under the percentage-of-completion method.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  For some contracts, on which some level of profit is assured, a contractor may only be able to estimate total contract revenue and total contract cost in ranges of amounts.  If, based on the information arising in estimating the ranges of amounts and all other pertinent data, the contractor can determine the amounts in the ranges that are most likely to occur, those amounts shall be used in accounting for the contract under the percentage-of-completion method.  If the most likely amounts cannot be determined, the lowest possible level of profit in the range shall be used in accounting for the contract until the results can be estimated more precisely.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  However, in some circumstances, estimating the final outcome may be impractical except to assure that no loss will be incurred.  In those circumstances, a contractor shall use a zero estimate of profit; equal amounts of revenue and cost shall be recognized until results can be estimated more precisely.  A contractor shall use this basis only if the bases in (a) or (b) are clearly not appropriate.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-61</b>  An entity using the percentage-of-completion method as its basic accounting policy shall use the completed-contract method for a single contract or group of contracts for which reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made or for which inherent hazards make estimates doubtful.
