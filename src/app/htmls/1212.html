</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(ii)</b> the carryback of such loss does not increase or produce a net operating loss (as defined in section 172 (c)) for the taxable year to which it is being carried back;

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the capital gain net income for any such prior taxable year shall be computed without regard to the net capital loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter. In the case of any net capital loss which cannot be carried back in full to a preceding taxable year by reason of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), the capital gain net income for such prior taxable year shall in no case be treated as greater than the amount of such loss which can be carried back to such preceding taxable year upon the application of such clause (ii).
