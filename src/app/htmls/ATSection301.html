<p class="header">Introduction
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at30101">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01</b>  This section sets forth standards and provides guidance to practitioners who are engaged to issue or do issue examination (paragraphs .29-.50), compilation (paragraphs .12-.28), or agreed-upon procedures reports (paragraphs .51-.56) on prospective financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02</b>  Whenever a practitioner (a) submits, to his or her client or others, prospective financial statements that he or she has assembled, or assisted in assembling, that are or reasonably might be expected to be used by another (third) party<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 1</sup> or (b) reports on prospective financial statements that are, or reasonably might be expected to be used by another (third) party, the practitioner should perform one of the engagements described in the preceding paragraph. In deciding whether the prospective financial statements are or reasonably might be expected to be used by a third party, the practitioner may rely on either the written or oral representation of the responsible party, unless information comes to his or her attention that contradicts the responsible party's representation. If such third-party use of the prospective financial statements is not reasonably expected, the provisions of this section are not applicable unless the practitioner has been engaged to examine, compile, or apply agreed-upon procedures to the prospective financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03</b>  This section also provides standards for a practitioner who is engaged to examine, compile, or apply agreed-upon procedures to partial presentations. A partial presentation is a presentation of prospective financial information that excludes one or more of the items required for prospective financial statements as described in appendix A [paragraph .68], "Minimum Presentation Guidelines."
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04</b>  The practitioner who has been engaged to or does compile, examine, or apply agreed-upon procedures to a partial presentation should perform the engagement in accordance with the guidance in paragraphs .12-.28 for compilations, locked content.29-.50Open this link as a new document for examinations, and locked content.51-.56Open this link as a new document for agreed-upon procedures, respectively, modified to reflect the nature of the presentation as discussed in paragraphs .03, .57, and .58.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05</b>  This section does not provide standards or procedures for engagements involving prospective financial statements used solely in connection with litigation support services. A practitioner may, however, look to these standards because they provide helpful guidance for many aspects of such engagements and may be referred to as useful guidance in such engagements. Litigation support services are engagements involving pending or potential formal legal proceedings before a trier of fact in connection with the resolution of a dispute between two or more parties, for example, when a practitioner acts as an expert witness. This exception is provided because, among other things, the practitioner's work in such proceedings is ordinarily subject to detailed analysis and challenge by each party to the dispute. This exception does not apply, however, if either of the following occur.


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    The practitioner is specifically engaged to issue or does issue an examination, a compilation, or an agreed-upon procedures report on prospective financial statements. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    The prospective financial statements are for use by third parties who, under the rules of the proceedings, do not have the opportunity for analysis and challenge by each party to a dispute in a legal proceeding.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">For example, creditors may not have such opportunities when prospective financial statements are submitted to them to secure their agreement to a plan of reorganization.
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06</b>  In reporting on prospective financial statements, the practitioner may be called on to assist the responsible party in identifying assumptions, gathering information, or assembling the statements.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup> The responsible party is nonetheless responsible for the preparation and presentation of the prospective financial statements because the prospective financial statements are dependent on the actions, plans, and assumptions of the responsible party, and only it can take responsibility for the assumptions. Accordingly, the practitioner's engagement should not be characterized in his or her report or in the document containing his or her report as including "preparation" of the prospective financial statements. A practitioner may be engaged to prepare a financial analysis of a potential project where the engagement includes obtaining the information, making appropriate assumptions, and assembling the presentation. Such an analysis is not and should not be characterized as a forecast or projection and would not be appropriate for general use. However, if the responsible party reviewed and adopted the assumptions and presentation, or based its assumptions and presentation on the analysis, the practitioner could perform one of the engagements described in this section and issue a report appropriate for general use.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07</b>  The concept of materiality affects the application of this section to prospective financial statements as materiality affects the application of generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) to historical financial statements. Materiality is a concept that is judged in light of the expected range of reasonableness of the information; therefore, users should not expect prospective information (information about events that have not yet occurred) to be as precise as historical information.

<p class="header">Definitions
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at30108">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08  </b>For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply.


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.    Prospective financial statements</i> - Either financial forecasts or financial projections including the summaries of significant assumptions and accounting policies. Although prospective financial statements may cover a period that has partially expired, statements for periods that have completely expired are not considered to be prospective financial statements. Pro forma financial statements and partial presentations are not considered to be prospective financial statements.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 3</sup>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.    Partial presentation</i> - A presentation of prospective financial information that excludes one or more of the items required for prospective financial statements as described in appendix A (paragraph .68O), "Minimum Presentation Guidelines." Partial presentations are not ordinarily appropriate for general use; accordingly, partial presentations should be restricted for use by specified parties who will be negotiating directly with the responsible party.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">c.    Financial forecast</i> - Prospective financial statements that present, to the best of the responsible party's knowledge and belief, an entity's expected financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A financial forecast is based on the responsible party's assumptions reflecting the conditions it expects to exist and the course of action it expects to take. A financial forecast may be expressed in specific monetary amounts as a single point estimate of forecasted results or as a range, where the responsible party selects key assumptions to form a range within which it reasonably expects, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the item or items subject to the assumptions to actually fall. When a forecast contains a range, the range is not selected in a biased or misleading manner, for example, a range in which one end is significantly less expected than the other. Minimum presentation guidelines for prospective financial statements are set forth in appendix A (paragraph .68).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d.    Financial projection</i> - Prospective financial statements that present, to the best of the responsible party's knowledge and belief, given one or more hypothetical assumptions, an entity's expected financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A financial projection is sometimes prepared to present one or more hypothetical courses of action for evaluation, as in response to a question such as, "What would happen if ...?" A financial projection is based on the responsible party's assumptions reflecting conditions it expects would exist and the course of action it expects would be taken, given one or more hypothetical assumptions. A projection, like a forecast, may contain a range. Minimum presentation guidelines for prospective financial statements are set forth in appendix A (paragraph .68).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">e.    Entity</i> - Any unit, existing or to be formed, for which financial statements could be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or another comprehensive basis of accounting.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 4</sup> For example, an entity can be an individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, association, or governmental unit.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">f.    Hypothetical assumption</i> - An assumption used in a financial projection to present a condition or course of action that is not necessarily expected to occur, but is consistent with the purpose of the projection.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">g.    Responsible party</i> - The person or persons who are responsible for the assumptions underlying the prospective financial statements. The responsible party usually is management, but it can be persons outside of the entity who do not currently have the authority to direct operations (for example, a party considering acquiring the entity).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">h.    Assembly</i> - The manual or computer processing of mathematical or other clerical functions related to the presentation of the prospective financial statements. Assembly does not refer to the mere reproduction and collation of such statements or to the responsible party's use of the practitioner's computer processing hardware or software.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">i.    Key factors</i> - The significant matters on which an entity's future results are expected to depend. Such factors are basic to the entity's operations and thus encompass matters that affect, among other things, the entity's sales, production, service, and financing activities. Key factors serve as a foundation for prospective financial statements and are the bases for the assumptions.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Uses of Prospective Financial Statements</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ffp1">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09</b>  Prospective financial statements are for either general use or limited use. General use  of prospective financial statements refers to the use of the statements by persons with whom the responsible party is not negotiating directly, for example, in an offering statement of an entity's debt or equity interests. Because recipients of prospective financial statements distributed for general use are unable to ask the responsible party directly about the presentation, the presentation most useful to them is one that portrays, to the best of the responsible party's knowledge and belief, the expected results. Thus, only a financial forecast is appropriate for general use.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ffp2">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.10</b>  Limited use of prospective financial statements refers to the use of prospective financial statements by the responsible party alone or by the responsible party and third parties with whom the responsible party is negotiating directly. Examples include use in negotiations for a bank loan, submission to a regulatory agency, and use solely within the entity. Third-party recipients of prospective financial statements intended for limited use can ask questions of the responsible party and negotiate terms directly with it. Any type of prospective financial statements that would be useful in the circumstances would normally be appropriate for limited use. Thus, the presentation may be a financial forecast or a financial projection.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ffp3">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11</b>  Because a financial projection is not appropriate for general use, a practitioner should not consent to the use of his or her name in conjunction with a financial projection that he or she believes will be distributed to those who will not be negotiating directly with the responsible party, for example, in an offering statement of an entity's debt or equity interests, unless the projection is used to supplement a financial forecast.
</p>
</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Compilation of Prospective Financial Statements</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at30112">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12  </b>A compilation of prospective financial statements is a professional service that involves the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    Assembling, to the extent necessary, the prospective financial statements based on the responsible party's assumptions
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    Performing the required compilation procedures,<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 5</sup> including reading the prospective financial statements with their summaries of significant assumptions and accounting policies, and considering whether they appear to be presented in conformity with AICPA presentation guidelines<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 6</sup> and not obviously inappropriate
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.    Issuing a compilation report
</p>

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.13  </b>A compilation is not intended to provide assurance on the prospective financial statements or the assumptions underlying such statements. Because of the limited nature of the practitioner's procedures, a compilation does not provide assurance that the practitioner will become aware of significant matters that might be disclosed by more extensive procedures, for example, those performed in an examination of prospective financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.14  </b>The summary of significant assumptions is essential to the reader's understanding of prospective financial statements. Accordingly, the practitioner should not compile prospective financial statements that exclude disclosure of the summary of significant assumptions. Also, the practitioner should not compile a financial projection that excludes either (a) an identification of the hypothetical assumptions or (b) a description of the limitations on the usefulness of the presentation.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.15  </b>The following standards apply to a compilation of prospective financial statements and to the resulting report.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    The compilation should be performed by a person or persons having adequate technical training and proficiency to compile prospective financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    Due professional care should be exercised in the performance of the compilation and the preparation of the report.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.    The work should be adequately planned, and assistants, if any, should be properly supervised.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.    Applicable compilation procedures should be performed as a basis for reporting on the compiled prospective financial statements. (See appendix B [paragraph .69], "Training and Proficiency, Planning and Procedures Applicable to Compilations," for the procedures to be performed.)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.    The report based on the practitioner's compilation of prospective financial statements should conform to the applicable guidance in paragraphs .18-.28.
</p>

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16  </b>The practitioner should consider, after applying the procedures specified in paragraph .69, whether representations or other information he or she has received appear to be obviously inappropriate, incomplete, or otherwise misleading, and if so, the practitioner should attempt to obtain additional or revised information. If he or she does not receive such information, the practitioner should ordinarily withdraw from the compilation engagement.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 7</sup>  (Note that the omission of disclosures, other than those relating to significant assumptions, would not require the practitioner to withdraw. See paragraph .26.)
