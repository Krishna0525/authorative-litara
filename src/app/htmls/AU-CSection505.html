<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc50501">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section addresses the auditor's use of external confirmation procedures to obtain audit evidence, in accordance with the requirements of section 330, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained</i>, and section 500, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Audit Evidence</i>.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">External Confirmation Procedures to Obtain Audit Evidence</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc50502">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>Section 500 indicates that the reliability of audit evidence is influenced by its source and nature and is dependent on the individual circumstances under which it is obtained.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 1</sup> Section 500 also includes the following generalizations applicable to audit evidence:<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>

Audit evidence is more reliable when it is obtained from independent sources outside the entity.
</li>

<li>Audit evidence obtained directly by the auditor is more reliable than audit evidence obtained indirectly or by inference.</li>

<li>Audit evidence is more reliable when it exists in documentary form, whether paper, electronic, or other medium.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">Accordingly, depending on the circumstances of the audit, audit evidence in the form of external confirmations received directly by the auditor from confirming parties may be more reliable than evidence generated internally by the entity. This section is intended to assist the auditor in designing and performing external confirmation procedures to obtain relevant and reliable audit evidence.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc50503">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03  </b>Other AU-C sections recognize the importance of external confirmations as audit evidence; for example

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>section 330 discusses the auditor's responsibility (a) to design and implement overall responses to address the assessed risks of material misstatement at the financial statement level and (b) to design and perform further audit procedures whose nature, timing, and extent are based on, and are responsive to, the assessed risks of material misstatement at the relevant assertion level.<sup>fn 3</sup> In addition, section 330 requires that, irrespective of the assessed risks of material misstatement, the auditor design and perform substantive procedures for all relevant assertions related to each material class of transactions, account balance, and disclosure.<sup>fn 4</sup> The auditor is required to consider whether external confirmation procedures are to be performed as substantive audit procedures and is required to use external confirmation procedures for accounts receivable unless

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>the overall account balance is immaterial, </li>

<li>external confirmation procedures would be ineffective, or</li>

<li>the auditor's assessed level of risk of material misstatement at the relevant assertion level is low, and the other planned substantive procedures address the assessed risk.<sup>fn 5</sup>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>

<li>section 330 requires that the auditor obtain more persuasive audit evidence the higher the auditor's assessment of risk.<sup>fn 6</sup> To do this, the auditor may increase the quantity of the evidence or obtain evidence that is more relevant or reliable, or both. For example, the auditor may place more emphasis on obtaining evidence directly from third parties or obtaining corroborating evidence from a number of independent sources. Section 330 also indicates that external confirmation procedures may assist the auditor in obtaining audit evidence with the high level of reliability that the auditor requires to respond to significant risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.<sup>fn 7</sup>
</li>

<li>section 240, Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit, indicates that the auditor may design confirmation requests to obtain additional corroborative information as a response to address the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud at the assertion level.<sup>fn 8</sup>
</li>

<li>section 500 indicates that corroborating information obtained from a source independent of the entity (such as external confirmations) may increase the assurance the auditor obtains from evidence existing within the accounting records or representations made by management.<sup>fn 9</sup>
</li>
</ul>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12  </b>The audit documentation of the results of auditing procedures directed at the tax accounts and related disclosures also includes sufficient appropriate audit evidence about the significant elements of the entity's tax liability contingency analysis. This audit documentation includes copies of the entity's documents, schedules, or analyses (or auditor-prepared summaries thereof) to enable the auditor to support his or her conclusions regarding the appropriateness of the entity's accounting and disclosure of significant tax-related contingency matters. The audit documentation reflects the procedures performed and conclusions reached by the auditor and, for significant matters, include the entity's documentary support for its financial statement amounts and disclosures.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc50513">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.13  </b>The audit documentation includes the significant elements of the entity's analysis of tax contingencies or reserves, including roll-forward of material changes to such reserves. In addition, the audit documentation provides the entity's position and support for income tax related disclosures, such as its effective tax rate reconciliation, and support for its intraperiod allocation of income tax expense or benefit to continuing operations and to items other than continuing operations. When applicable, the audit documentation also includes the entity's basis for assessing deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances and its support for applying the "indefinite reversal criteria" discussed in FASB ASC 740-30-25-17, including its specific plans for reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc50515">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.15  </b>In such circumstances, rather than inspecting and obtaining documentary evidence of the entity's tax liability contingency analysis and making inquiries of the entity, may the auditor consider the counsel as a management's specialist within the meaning of section 500 and rely solely on counsel's opinion as an appropriate procedure for obtaining audit evidence to support his or her opinion on the financial statements?
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc50516">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16  </b>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interpretation</i>—No. The opinion of legal counsel in this situation does not provide sufficient appropriate audit evidence to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion on the financial statements. The opinion of legal counsel on specific tax issues that he or she is asked to address and to which he or she has devoted substantive attention, as contemplated by the legal counsel's response to an auditor's letter of inquiry, can be useful to the auditor in forming his or her own opinion.
