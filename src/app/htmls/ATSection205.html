<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .01</b>This section contains performance and reporting requirements and application
guidance for all examination engagements. The requirements and
guidance in this section supplement the requirements and guidance in section
105, <i>Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements</i></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective Date</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .02</b>This section is effective for practitioners' examination reports dated on
or after May 1, 2017.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objectives</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .03</b>In conducting an examination engagement, the objectives of the practitioner
are to
<ol type="a">
	<li>obtain reasonable assurance about whether the subject matter as
measured or evaluated against the criteria is free from material
misstatement;</li>
<li>express an opinion in a written report about whether</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li> the subject matter is in accordance with (or based on) the
criteria, in all material respects, or</li>
<li>the responsible party's assertion is fairly stated, in all material
respects; and</li>
</ol>
<li>communicate further as required by relevant AT-C sections.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definitions</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .04</b>For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
attributed as follows:
<p><b>Appropriateness of evidence.</b> The measure of the quality of evidence,
that is, its relevancy and reliability in providing support
for the practitioner's opinion.	</p>
<p>	<b>Modified opinion.</b> A qualified opinion, an adverse opinion, or a disclaimer
of opinion.</p>
<p><b>Risk of material misstatement.</b> The risk that the subject matter
is not in accordance with (or based on) the criteria in all material respects or that the assertion is not fairly stated, in all material
respects.	</p>
<p><b>	Sufficiency of evidence.</b> The measure of the quantity of evidence.
The quantity of the evidence needed is affected by the risks of
material misstatement and also by the quality of such evidence.</p>
<p><b>Test of controls.</b> A procedure designed to evaluate the operating effectiveness
of controls in preventing, or detecting and correcting,
material misstatements in the subject matter</p>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requirements</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conduct of an Examination Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .05</b>In performing an examination engagement, the practitioner should
comply with this section, section 105, and any subject-matter AT-C section that
is relevant to the engagement. A subject-matter AT-C section is relevant to the
engagement when it is in effect, and the circumstances addressed by the AT-C
section exist. (Ref: par. .A1)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preconditions for an Examination Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .06</b>Section 105 indicates that a practitioner must be independent when
performing an attestation engagement in accordance with the attestation standards,
unless the practitioner is required by law or regulation to accept the engagement
and report on the subject matter or assertion.1 When the practitioner
is not independent but is required by law or regulation to accept the engagement
and report on the subject matter or assertion, the practitioner should
disclaim an opinion and should specifically state that the practitioner is not independent.
The practitioner is neither required to provide, nor precluded from
providing, the reasons for the lack of independence; however, if the practitioner
chooses to provide the reasons for the lack of independence, the practitioner
should include all the reasons therefor</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agreeing on the Terms of the Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .07</b>The practitioner should agree upon the terms of the engagement with
the engaging party. The agreed-upon terms of the engagement should be specified
in sufficient detail in an engagement letter or other suitable form of written
agreement. (Ref: par. .A2)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .08</b>The agreed-upon terms of the engagement should include the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The objective and scope of the engagement</li>
	<li>The responsibilities of the practitioner (Ref: par. .A3)</li>
	<li>A statement that the engagement will be conducted in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants</li>
	<li>The responsibilities of the responsible party and the responsibilities
of the engaging party, if different</li>
	<li>A statement about the inherent limitations of an examination engagement
(Ref: par. .A4)</li>
	<li>Identification of the criteria for the measurement, evaluation, or
disclosure of the subject matter</li>
	<li>An acknowledgement that the engaging party agrees to provide
the practitioner with a representation letter at the conclusion of
the engagement</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .09</b>Although an engagement may recur, each engagement is considered a
separate engagement. The practitioner should assess whether circumstances
require revision to the terms of a preceding engagement. If the practitioner
concludes that the terms of the preceding engagement need not be revised for
the current engagement, the practitioner should remind the engaging party of
the terms of the current engagement, and the reminder should be documented</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requesting a Written Assertion</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .10</b>The practitioner should request from the responsible party a written
assertion about the measurement or evaluation of the subject matter against
the criteria. When the engaging party is the responsible party and refuses to
provide a written assertion, paragraph .82 requires the practitioner to withdraw
from the engagement when withdrawal is possible under applicable law
or regulation. When the engaging party is not the responsible party, and the
responsible party refuses to provide a written assertion, the practitioner need
not withdraw from the engagement. In that case, paragraph .84 requires the
practitioner to disclose that refusal in the practitioner's report and restrict the
use of the report to the engaging party. (Ref: par. .A5–.A8 and .A97)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Planning and Performing the Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .11</b>The practitioner should establish an overall engagement strategy that
sets the scope, timing, and direction of the engagement and guides the development
of the engagement plan. (Ref: par. .A9–.A12)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .12</b>In establishing the overall engagement strategy, the practitioner
should
<ol type="a">
	<li>identify the characteristics of the engagement that define its
scope and ascertain the reporting objectives of the engagement
in order to plan the timing of the engagement and the nature of
the communications required;</li>
	<li>consider the factors that, in the practitioner's professional judgment,
are significant in directing the engagement team's efforts;</li>
	<li>consider the results of preliminary engagement activities, such
as client acceptance, and, when applicable, whether knowledge
gained on other engagements performed by the engagement partner
for the entity is relevant; and</li>
	<li>ascertain the nature, timing, and extent of resources necessary to
perform the engagement.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .13</b>The practitioner should develop a plan that includes a description of
the following items:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The nature, timing, and extent of planned risk assessment procedures</li>
	<li>The nature, timing, and extent of planned further procedures (see
paragraph .21)</li>
	<li>Other planned procedures that are required to be carried out so
that the engagement complies with the attestation standards</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Risk Assessment Procedures</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .14</b>The practitioner should obtain an understanding of the subject matter
and other engagement circumstances sufficient to (Ref: par. .A13–.A14)
<ol type="a">
	<li>enable the practitioner to identify and assess the risks of material
misstatement in the subject matter and</li>
<li>provide a basis for designing and performing procedures to respond
to the assessed risks and to obtain reasonable assurance to
support the practitioner's opinion</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .15</b>In obtaining an understanding of the subject matter in accordance with
paragraph .14, the practitioner should obtain an understanding of internal control
over the preparation of the subject matter relevant to the engagement. This
includes evaluating the design of those controls relevant to the subject matter
and determining whether they have been implemented by performing procedures
in addition to inquiry of the personnel responsible for the subject matter</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Materiality in Planning and Performing the Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .16</b>When establishing the overall engagement strategy, the practitioner
should consider materiality for the subject matter. (Ref: par. .A15–.A21)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .17</b>The practitioner should reconsider materiality for the subject matter
if the practitioner becomes aware of information during the engagement that
would have caused the practitioner to have initially determined a different materiality</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identifying Risks of Material Misstatement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .18</b>The practitioner should identify and assess risks of material misstatement
as the basis for designing and performing further procedures whose nature,
timing, and extent (Ref: par. .A22–.A23)
<ol type="a">
	<li>are responsive to assessed risks of material misstatement and</li>
	<li>allow the practitioner to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the subject matter is in accordance with (or based on)
the criteria, in all material respects.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responding to Assessed Risks and Obtaining Evidence</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .19</b>To obtain reasonable assurance, the practitioner should obtain sufficient
appropriate evidence to reduce attestation risk to an acceptably low level
and thereby enable the practitioner to draw reasonable conclusions on which
to base the practitioner's opinion.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .20</b>The practitioner should design and implement overall responses to address
the assessed risks of material misstatement for the subject matter or assertion.
(Ref: par. .A24–.A25)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further Procedures</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .21</b>The practitioner should design and perform further procedures whose
nature, timing, and extent are based on, and responsive to, the assessed risks
of material misstatement.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .22</b>In designing and performing further procedures in accordance with
paragraph .21, the practitioner should
<ol type="a">
	<li>consider the reasons for the assessment given to the risk of material
misstatement, including</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li>the likelihood of material misstatement due to the particular
characteristics of the subject matter and</li>
<li> whether the practitioner intends to rely on the operating
effectiveness of controls in determining the nature, timing,
and extent of other procedures, and</li>
</ol>
<li>obtain more persuasive evidence the higher the practitioner's assessment
of risk</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .23</b>When designing and performing procedures, the practitioner should
consider the relevance and reliability of the information to be used as evidence.
If
<ol type="a">
	<li>evidence obtained from one source is inconsistent with that obtained
from another,</li>
	<li>the practitioner has doubts about the reliability of information to
be used as evidence, or</li>
	<li>responses to inquiries of the responsible party or others are inconsistent
or otherwise unsatisfactory (for example, vague or implausible),</li>
</ol>
<p>the practitioner should determine what modifications or additions to procedures
are necessary to resolve the matter and should consider the effect of the
matter, if any, on other aspects of the engagement.</p>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Tests of Controls</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .24</b>The practitioner should design and perform tests of controls to obtain
sufficient appropriate evidence about the operating effectiveness of relevant
controls if
<ol type="a">
	<li>the practitioner intends to rely on the operating effectiveness of
controls in determining the nature, timing, and extent of other
procedures;</li>
	<li>procedures other than tests of controls cannot alone provide sufficient
appropriate evidence; or</li>
<li>the subject matter is internal control.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .25</b>If the practitioner designed and performed tests of controls to rely on
their operating effectiveness and identified deviations in those controls, the
practitioner should make specific inquiries and perform other procedures as
necessary to understand these matters and their potential consequences. The
practitioner also should determine whether
<ol type="a">
	<li>the tests of controls that have been performed provide an appropriate
basis for reliance on the controls,</li>
	<li>the potential risks of misstatement need to be addressed using
other procedures.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Procedures Other Than Tests of Controls</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .26</b>Irrespective of the assessed risks of material misstatement, the practitioner
should design and perform tests of details or analytical procedures related
to the subject matter, except when the subject matter is internal control.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Analytical Procedures Performed in Response to Assessed Risks</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .27</b>When designing and performing analytical procedures in response to
assessed risks, the practitioner should (Ref: par. .A26–.A27)
<ol type="a">
	<li>determine the suitability of particular analytical procedures for
the subject matter, taking into account the assessed risks of material
misstatement and any related tests of details;</li>
	<li>evaluate the reliability of data from which the practitioner's expectation
is developed, taking into account the source, comparability,
nature, and relevance of information available, and controls
over their preparation; and</li>
	<li>develop an expectation that is sufficiently precise to identify possible
material misstatements (taking into account whether analytical
procedures are to be performed alone or in combination
with tests of details).</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .28</b>If analytical procedures identify fluctuations or relationships that are
inconsistent with other relevant information or that differ significantly from
expected amounts or ratios, the practitioner should investigate such differences
by
<ol type="a">
	<li>inquiring of the responsible party and obtaining additional evidence
relevant to its responses and</li>
	<li>performing other procedures as necessary in the circumstances.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Procedures Regarding Estimates</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .29</b>Based on the assessed risks of material misstatement, the practitioner
should evaluate whether
<ol type="a">
	<li>the responsible party has appropriately applied the requirements
of the criteria relevant to any estimated amounts and</li>
	<li>the methods for making estimates are appropriate and have been
applied consistently and whether changes, if any, in reported estimates
or in the method for making them from the prior period,
if applicable, are appropriate in the circumstances.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .30</b>Based on the assessed risks of material misstatement, the practitioner
should evaluate whether
<ol type="a">
	<li>Determine whether events occurring up to the date of the practitioner's
report provide evidence regarding the estimate.</li>
	<li>Test how the responsible party made the estimate and the data
on which it is based. In doing so, the practitioner should evaluate
whether the</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li>method of measurement used is appropriate in the circumstances</li>
	<li>assumptions used by the responsible party are reasonable,
and</li>
	<li> data on which the estimate is based are sufficiently reliable
for the practitioner's purposes.</li>
</ol>
<li>Test the operating effectiveness of the controls over how the responsible
party made the estimate, together with other appropriate
further procedures.</li>
<li>Develop a point estimate or a range to evaluate the responsible
party's estimate. For this purpose, if the practitioner</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li> uses assumptions or methods that differ from those of the
responsible party, the practitioner should obtain an understanding
of the responsible party's assumptions or methods
sufficient to establish that the practitioner's point estimate
or range takes into account relevant variables and
to evaluate any significant differences from the responsible
party's point estimate.</li>
	<li> concludes that it is appropriate to use a range, the practitioner
should narrow the range, based on evidence available,
until all outcomes within the range are considered
reasonable.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Sampling</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .31</b>If sampling is used, the practitioner should, when designing the sample,
consider the purpose of the procedure and the characteristics of the population
from which the sample will be drawn. Sampling involves (Ref: par. .A28)
<ol type="a">
	<li>determining a sample size sufficient to reduce sampling risk to
an acceptably low level.</li>
	<li>selecting items for the sample in such a way that the practitioner
can reasonably expect the sample to be representative of the relevant
population and likely to provide the practitioner with a reasonable
basis for conclusions about the population</li>
	<li>treating a selected item to which the practitioner is unable to apply
the designed procedures or suitable alternative procedures as
a deviation from the prescribed control in the case of tests of controls
or a misstatement in the case of tests of details.</li>
<li>investigating the nature and cause of deviations or misstatements
identified and evaluating their possible effect on the purpose
of the procedure and on other areas of the engagement.</li>
<li>evaluating the results of the sample, including sampling risk and
projecting misstatements found in the sample to the population,
and</li>
<li>evaluating whether the use of sampling has provided an appropriate
basis for conclusions about the population that has been
tested.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fraud, Laws, and Regulations</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .32</b>The practitioner should
<ol type="a">
	<li>consider whether risk assessment procedures and other procedures
related to understanding the subject matter indicate risk of
material misstatement due to fraud or noncompliance with laws
or regulations.</li>
	<li>make inquiries of appropriate parties to determine whether they
have knowledge of any actual, suspected, or alleged fraud or noncompliance
with laws or regulations affecting the subject matter.</li>
	<li>evaluate whether there are unusual or unexpected relationships
within the subject matter, or between the subject matter and
other related information, that indicate risks of material misstatement
due to fraud or noncompliance with laws or regulations</li>
<li>evaluate whether other information obtained indicates risk of material
misstatement due to fraud or noncompliance with laws or
regulations.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .33</b>The practitioner should respond appropriately to fraud or suspected
fraud and noncompliance or suspected noncompliance with laws or regulations
affecting the subject matter that is identified during the engagement. (Ref: par.
.A29–.A30)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Revision of Risk Assessment</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .34</b>The practitioner's assessment of the risks of material misstatement
may change during the course of the engagement as additional evidence is obtained.
In circumstances in which the practitioner obtains evidence from performing
further procedures, or if new information is obtained, either of which
is inconsistent with the evidence on which the practitioner originally based
the assessment, the practitioner should revise the assessment and modify the
planned procedures accordingly. (Ref: par. .A31–.A32)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluating the Reliability of Information Produced by the Entity</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .35</b>TWhen using information produced by the entity, the practitioner should
evaluate whether the information is sufficiently reliable for the practitioner's
purposes, including, as necessary, the following: (Ref: par. .A33–.A34)
<ol type="a">
	<li>Obtaining evidence about the accuracy and completeness of the
information</li>
	<li>Evaluating whether the information is sufficiently precise and detailed
for the practitioner's purposes</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the Work of a Practitioner’s Specialist</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .36</b>When the practitioner expects to use the work of a practitioner's specialist,
the practitioner should do the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>Evaluate whether the practitioner's specialist has the necessary
competence, capabilities, and objectivity for the practitioner's purposes.
In the case of a practitioner's external specialist, the evaluation
of objectivity should include inquiry regarding interests
and relationships that may create a threat to the objectivity of
the practitioner's specialist. (Ref: par. .A38–.A41)</li>
<li>Obtain a sufficient understanding of the field of expertise of a
practitioner's specialist to enable the practitioner to (Ref: par.
.A42)</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li>determine the nature, scope, and objectives of that specialist's
work for the practitioner's purposes and</li>
	<li>evaluate the adequacy of that work for the practitioner's
purposes.</li>
</ol>
<li>Agree with the practitioner's specialist regarding (Ref: par. .A43)</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li>the nature, scope, and objectives of that practitioner's specialist's
work;</li>
	<li> the respective roles and responsibilities of the practitioner
and that specialist;</li>
	<li> the nature, timing, and extent of communication between
the practitioner and that specialist, including the form of any report or documentation to be provided by that specialist;
and</li>
	<li>the need for the practitioner's specialist to observe confidentiality
requirements.</li>
</ol>
<li> Evaluate the adequacy of the work of the practitioner's specialist
for the practitioner's purposes, including</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li> the relevance and reasonableness of the findings and conclusions
of the practitioner's specialist and their consistency
with other evidence;</li>
<li> if the work of the practitioner's specialist involves the use
of significant assumptions and methods</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
	<li>obtaining an understanding of those assumptions
and methods and</li>
	<li> evaluating the relevance and reasonableness of
those assumptions and methods in the circumstances,
giving consideration to the rationale and
support provided by the practitioner's specialist,
and in relation to the practitioner's other findings
and conclusions;</li>
</ol>
<li> if the work of the practitioner's specialist involves the use
of source data that are significant to the work of the practitioner's
specialist, the relevance, completeness, and accuracy
of that source data</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .37</b>If the practitioner determines that the work of the practitioner's specialist
is not adequate for the practitioner's purposes, the practitioner should
<ol type="a">
	<li>agree with the practitioner's specialist on the nature and extent
of further work to be performed by the practitioner's specialist or</li>
	<li>perform additional procedures appropriate to the circumstances.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .38</b>The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures a practitioner performs
when the practitioner expects to use the work of a practitioner's specialist
will vary depending on the circumstances. In determining the nature, timing,
and extent of those procedures, the practitioner should consider the following:
(See section 105.2)
<ol type="a">
	<li>The significance of that specialist's work in the context of the engagement
(See also paragraphs .A35–.A36.)</li>
	<li>The nature of the matter to which that specialist's work relates</li>
	<li>The risks of material misstatement in the matter to which that
specialist's work relates</li>
	<li>The practitioner's knowledge of, and experience with, previous
work performed by that specialist</li>
	<li> Whether that specialist is subject to the practitioner's firm's quality
control policies and procedures (see also paragraph .A37)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the Work of Internal Auditors</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .39</b>When the practitioner expects to use the work of the internal audit
function in obtaining evidence or to use internal auditors to provide direct assistance,
the practitioner should determine whether the work can be used for
purposes of the examination by evaluating (Ref: par. .A44–.A46)
<ol type="a">
	<li>the level of competence of the internal audit function or the individual
internal auditors providing direct assistance;</li>
	<li>the extent to which the internal audit function's organizational
status and relevant policies and procedures support the objectivity
of the internal audit function or for internal auditors providing
direct assistance, the existence of threats to the objectivity
of those internal auditors and the related safeguards applied to
reduce or eliminate those threats; and</li>
<li>when using the work of the internal audit function, the application
by the internal audit function of a systematic and disciplined
approach, including quality control.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .40</b>When using the work of the internal audit function, the practitioner
should perform sufficient procedures on the body of work of the internal audit
function as a whole that the practitioner plans to use to determine its adequacy
for the purpose of the examination engagement, including reperforming some
of the body of work of the internal audit function that the practitioner intends
to use in obtaining evidence.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .41</b>Prior to using internal auditors to provide direct assistance, the practitioner
should obtain written acknowledgment from the responsible party that
internal auditors providing direct assistance to the practitioner will be allowed
to follow the practitioner's instructions, and that the responsible party will not
intervene in the work the internal auditor performs for the practitioner</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .42</b>When using internal auditors to provide direct assistance to the practitioner,
the practitioner should direct, supervise, and review the work of the
internal auditors.</p>
<p>

(Ref: par. .05)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A1 </b> For example, if a practitioner were examining prospective financial
information, section 105, this section, and section 305, Prospective Financial
Information, would be relevant.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Agreeing on the Terms of the Engagement
(Ref: par. .07, .08b, and .08e)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A2 </b> It is in the interests of both the engaging party and the practitioner to
document the agreed-upon terms of the engagement before the commencement
of the engagement to help avoid misunderstandings. The form and content of
the engagement letter or other suitable form of written agreement will vary
with the engagement circumstances.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A3 </b> A practitioner may further describe the responsibilities of the practitioner
by adding the following items to the engagement letter or other suitable
form of written agreement:
<ol type="a">
	<li>A statement that an examination is designed to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the subject matter as measured or
evaluated against the criteria is free from material misstatement</li>
	<li>A statement that the objective of an examination is the expression
of an opinion in a written practitioner's report about whether the
subject matter is in accordance with (or based on) the criteria, in
all material respects, or whether the responsible party's assertion
is fairly stated, in all material respects</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A4 </b> If relevant, a statement about the inherent limitations of an examination
engagement may indicate that "because of the inherent limitations of
an examination engagement, together with the inherent limitations of internal
control, an unavoidable risk exists that some material misstatements may not
be detected, even though the examination is properly planned and performed
in accordance with the attestation standards."</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Requesting a Written Assertion (Ref: par. .10)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A5 </b> The language of the responsible party's written assertion in paragraph
.10 may need to be tailored to reflect the nature of the subject matter and criteria
for the engagement. Examples of language that meet the requirements in
paragraph .10 include the following:
<ul>
	<li>The entity maintained effective internal control over the subject
matter based on the criteria.</li>
	<li>The subject matter is presented in accordance with (or based on)
the criteria.</li>
	<li>The subject matter achieved the objectives, for example, when the
objectives are the criteria.</li>
	<li>The subject matter is presented fairly, based on the criteria.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A6 </b> Situations may arise in which the current responsible party was not
present during some or all of the period covered by the practitioner's report.
Such persons may contend that they are not in a position to provide a written
assertion that covers the entire period because they were not in place during
some or all of the period. This fact, however, does not diminish such persons'
responsibilities for the subject matter as a whole. Accordingly, the requirement
for the practitioner to request a written assertion from the responsible party
that covers the entire relevant period(s) still applies.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A7 </b> Paragraph .50a requires the practitioner to request a written representation
from the responsible party that is the same as the responsible party's
assertion. If the responsible party provides the practitioner with the written
representation in paragraph .50a, the practitioner need not request a separate
written assertion unless a separate written assertion is called for by the engagement
circumstances.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A8 </b> A practitioner may also be engaged to assist the responsible party
in measuring or evaluating the subject matter against the criteria in connection
with the responsible party providing a written assertion. Regardless of the
procedures performed by the practitioner, the responsible party is required to accept responsibility for its assertion and the subject matter and may not base
its assertion solely on the practitioner's procedures.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Planning and Performing the Engagement (Ref: par. .11)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A9 </b> Planning involves the engagement partner and other key members of
the engagement team and may involve the practitioner's specialists in developing
<ul>
	<li>an overall strategy for the scope, timing, and conduct of the engagement
and</li>
	<li>an engagement plan, consisting of a detailed approach for the nature,
timing, and extent of procedures to be performed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adequate planning helps the practitioner to devote appropriate attention to
important areas of the engagement, identify potential problems on a timely
basis, and properly organize and manage the engagement in order for it to be
performed in an effective and efficient manner. Adequate planning also assists
the practitioner in properly assigning work to engagement team members and
facilitates the direction, supervision, and review of their work. Further, it assists,
when applicable, the coordination of work performed by other practitioners
and practitioner's specialists. The nature and extent of planning activities
will vary with the engagement circumstances, for example, the complexity of
the assessment or evaluation of the subject matter and the practitioner's previous
experience with it. Examples of relevant matters that may be considered
include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The characteristics of the engagement that define its scope, including
the terms of the engagement, the characteristics of the
underlying subject matter, and the criteria</li>
	<li>The expected timing and the nature of the communications required</li>
	<li>The results of preliminary engagement activities, such as client
acceptance, and, when applicable, whether knowledge gained on
other engagements performed by the engagement partner for the
appropriate party(ies) is relevant</li>
	<li>The engagement process, including possible sources of evidence,
and choices among alternative measurement or evaluation methods</li>
	<li>The practitioner's understanding of the appropriate party(ies) and
its (their) environment, including the risks that the subject matter
may be materially misstated</li>
	<li>Identification of intended users and their information needs and
consideration of materiality and the components of attestation
risk</li>
	<li>The risk of fraud relevant to the engagement</li>
	<li>The effect on the engagement of using the internal audit function</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A10 </b> The practitioner may decide to discuss elements of planning with the
appropriate party(ies) to facilitate the conduct and management of the engagement
(for example, to coordinate some of the planned procedures with the work of the responsible party's personnel). Although these discussions often occur,
the overall engagement strategy and the engagement plan remain the practitioner's
responsibility. When discussing matters included in the overall engagement
strategy or engagement plan, care is needed to avoid compromising
the effectiveness of the engagement. For example, discussing the nature and
timing of detailed procedures with the responsible party may compromise the
effectiveness of the engagement by making the procedures too predictable.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A11 </b> Planning is not a discrete phase but, rather, a cumulative and iterative
process throughout the engagement. As a result of unexpected events,
changes in conditions, or evidence obtained, the practitioner may need to revise
the overall strategy and engagement plan and, thereby, the resulting nature,
timing, and extent of planned procedures.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A12 </b> In smaller or less complex engagements, the entire engagement may
be conducted by a very small engagement team, possibly involving the engagement
partner (who may be a sole practitioner) working without any other engagement
team members. With a smaller team, coordination of, and communication
among, team members is easier. In such cases, establishing the overall
engagement strategy need not be a complex or time-consuming exercise; it
varies according to the size of the entity, complexity of the engagement, and
size of the engagement team.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Risk Assessment Procedures (Ref: par. .14)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A13 </b> Obtaining an understanding of the subject matter and other engagement
circumstances provides the practitioner with a frame of reference for exercising
professional judgment throughout the engagement, for example, when
<ul>
	<li>considering the characteristics of the subject matter;</li>
	<li>assessing the suitability of criteria</li>
	<li>considering the factors that, in the practitioner's professional
judgment, are significant in directing the engagement team's efforts,
including situations in which special consideration may be
necessary (for example, when there is a need for specialized skills
or the work of a specialist);</li>
	<li>establishing and evaluating the continued appropriateness of
quantitative materiality levels (when appropriate) and considering
qualitative materiality factors;</li>
	<li>developing expectations when performing analytical procedures;</li>
	<li>designing and performing procedures;</li>
	<li>evaluating evidence, including the reasonableness of the written
representations received by the practitioner</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A14 </b> In assessing inherent risk, the practitioner may consider factors relevant
to examination engagements, such as the following:
<ul>
	<li>The complexity of the subject matter or assertion</li>
	<li>The length of time during which the entity has had experience
with the subject matter or assertion</li>
	<li>Prior experience with the entity's assessment of the subject matter
or assertion</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Materiality in Planning and Performing the Engagement
(Ref: par. .16)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A15 </b> Materiality is considered in the context of qualitative factors and,
when applicable, quantitative factors. The relative importance of qualitative
factors and quantitative factors when considering materiality in a particular
engagement is a matter for the practitioner's professional judgment.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A16 </b>Professional judgments about materiality are made in light of surrounding
circumstances, but they are not affected by the level of assurance,
that is, for the same intended users, materiality for an examination engagement
is the same as it is for a review engagement because materiality is based
on the information needs of intended users and not the level of assurance.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A17 </b>In general, misstatements, including omissions, are considered to be
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence relevant decisions of intended users that are made based on the
subject matter. The practitioner's consideration of materiality is a matter of
professional judgment and is affected by the practitioner's perception of the
common information needs of intended users as a group. In this context, it is
reasonable for the practitioner to assume that intended users
<ol type="a">
	<li>have a reasonable knowledge of the subject matter and a willingness
to study the subject matter with reasonable diligence.</li>
	<li>understand that the subject matter is measured or evaluated and
examined to appropriate levels of materiality and have an understanding
of any materiality concepts included in the criteria.</li>
	<li>understand any inherent uncertainties involved in measuring or
evaluating the subject matter.</li>
	<li>make reasonable decisions on the basis of the subject matter
taken as a whole.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless the engagement has been designed to meet the particular information
needs of specific users, the possible effect of misstatements on specific users,
whose information needs may vary widely, is not ordinarily considered.</p>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A18 </b>Qualitative factors may include the following:
<ul>
	<li>The interaction between, and relative importance of, various aspects
of the subject matter, such as numerous performance indicators</li>
	<li>The wording chosen with respect to subject matter that is expressed
in narrative form, for example, the wording chosen does
not omit or distort the information</li>
	<li>The characteristics of the presentation adopted for the subject
matter when the criteria allow for variations in that presentation</li>
	<li>The nature of a misstatement, for example, the nature of observed
deviations in the operation of a control when the responsible party
asserts that the control is effective</li>
	<li>Whether a misstatement affects compliance with laws or regulations</li>
	<li>In the case of periodic reporting on a subject matter, whether the
effect of an adjustment affects past or current information about
the subject matter or is likely to affect future information about
the subject matter</li>
<li>Whether a misstatement is the result of an intentional act or is
unintentional</li>
<li>Whether a misstatement is significant with regard to the practitioner's
understanding of known previous communications to
users, for example, in relation to the expected outcome of the measurement
or evaluation of the subject matter</li>
<li>Whether a misstatement relates to the relationship between the
responsible party, and if different, the engaging party or its relationship
with other parties</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A19 </b>Quantitative factors relate to the magnitude of misstatements relative
to reported amounts for those aspects of the subject matter, if any, that
are
<li>expressed numerically or</li>
<li>otherwise related to numerical values, for example, the number of
observed deviations in the operation of a control when the examination
involves the effectiveness of the control.</li>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A20 </b>When quantitative factors are applicable, planning the engagement
solely to detect individually material misstatements overlooks the fact that
the aggregate of individually immaterial misstatements may cause the subject
matter to be materially misstated. Applying materiality to elements of the
subject matter ordinarily is not a simple mechanical calculation but involves
the exercise of professional judgment. It is affected by the practitioner's understanding
of the subject matter and the responsible party, updated during the
performance of the risk assessment procedures, and consideration of the nature
and extent of misstatements identified in previous attestation engagements.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A21 </b>The criteria may discuss the concept of materiality in the context of
the preparation and presentation of the subject matter and thereby provide a
frame of reference for the practitioner in considering materiality for the engagement.
Although criteria may discuss materiality in different terms, the concept
of materiality generally includes the matters discussed in paragraphs .A15–
.A20. If the criteria do not include a discussion of the concept of materiality,
these paragraphs provide the practitioner with a frame of reference.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Identifying Risks of Material Misstatement (Ref: par. .18)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A22 </b> Most of the practitioner's work in forming an opinion consists of obtaining
and evaluating evidence. Procedures to obtain evidence can include inspection,
observation, confirmation, recalculation, reperformance, and analytical
procedures, often in some combination, in addition to inquiry</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A23 </b> In some cases, a subject-matter-specific section may include requirements
that affect the nature, timing, and extent of procedures. For example,
a subject-matter-specific section may describe the nature or extent of particular
procedures to be performed in a particular type of engagement. Even in
such cases, determining the exact nature, timing, and extent of procedures is
a matter of professional judgment and will vary from one engagement to the
next.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Responding to Assessed Risks and Obtaining Evidence
(Ref: par. .20)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A24 </b> Overall responses to address the assessed risks of material misstatement
of the subject matter or assertion may include
<ul>
	<li>emphasizing to the engagement team the need to maintain professional
skepticism;</li>
	<li>assigning more experienced staff or those with specialized skills
or using specialists;</li>
	<li>providing more supervision;</li>
	<li>incorporating additional elements of unpredictability in the selection
of further procedures to be performed; and</li>
	<li>making changes to the nature, timing, or extent of procedures (for
example, performing procedures at period-end instead of at an interim
date or modifying the nature of procedures to obtain more
persuasive evidence).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A25 </b> The assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the subject
matter or assertion is affected by the practitioner's understanding of the control
environment. An effective control environment may allow the practitioner
to have more confidence in internal control and the reliability of evidence generated
internally within the entity and, thus, for example, may allow the practitioner
to conduct some procedures at an interim date, rather than at the periodend.
Deficiencies in the control environment, however, have the opposite effect,
for example, the practitioner may respond to an ineffective control environment
by
<ul>
	<li>conducting more procedures as of the period-end, rather than at
an interim date.</li>
	<li>obtaining more extensive evidence from procedures other than
tests of controls, and</li>
	<li>increasing the number of locations to be included in the examination
scope.</li>

limitations of those procedures is important. Accordingly, the identification of
the relationships and types of data used, as well as conclusions reached when
recorded amounts are compared to expectations, requires professional judgment
by the practitioner.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A27 </b> Analytical procedures involve comparisons of expectations developed
by the practitioner to recorded amounts or ratios developed from recorded
amounts. The practitioner develops such expectations by identifying and using
plausible relationships that are reasonably expected to exist based on the
practitioner's understanding of the subject matter; the practices used by the
responsible party to measure, recognize, and record the subject matter; and, if

matters that require specialized skills and knowledge beyond those possessed
by the practitioner and for which the work of a practitioner's specialist
is used. In some situations, the practitioner's specialist will be consulted to provide
advice on an individual matter, but the greater the significance of the work
of the practitioner's specialist in the context of the engagement, the more likely
it is that the specialist will work as part of a multidisciplinary team comprising
subject-matter specialists and other attestation personnel. The more that
specialist's work is integrated in nature, timing, and extent with the overall
work effort, the more important effective two-way communication is between
the practitioner's specialist and other attestation personnel. Effective two-way
communication facilitates the proper integration of the specialist's work with
the work of others on the engagement.</p>

as the practitioner in performing all aspects of an examination engagement,
a practitioner's specialist whose work is used may need a sufficient understanding

work assigned to that specialist to the engagement objective.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A40 </b> The evaluation of the significance of threats to objectivity and of
whether there is a need for safeguards may depend upon the role of the practitioner's
specialist and the significance of the specialist's work in the context of
the engagement. There may be some circumstances in which safeguards cannot
reduce threats to an acceptable level, for example, if in an examination engagement
a practitioner's specialist is an individual who has played a significant
role in measuring, evaluating, or disclosing the subject matter.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A41 </b> When evaluating the objectivity of a practitioner's external specialist,
it may be relevant to
<ul>
	<li>inquire of the appropriate party(ies) about any known interests or
relationships that the appropriate party(ies) has with the practitioner's
external specialist that may affect that specialist's objectivity</li>
	<li>discuss with that specialist any applicable safeguards, including

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Using the Work of Internal Auditors (Ref: par. .39)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A44 </b> Activities similar to those performed by an internal audit function
may be conducted by functions with other titles within an entity. Some or all of
the activities of an internal audit function may also be outsourced to a thirdparty
service provider. Neither the title of the function nor whether it is performed
by the entity or a third-party service provider are sole determinants of
whether or not the practitioner can use the work of internal auditors. Rather, it
is the nature of the activities, the extent to which the internal audit function's
organizational status and relevant policies and procedures support the objectivity
of the internal auditors, the competence of the internal auditors, and the
systematic and disciplined approach of the function that are relevant. References
in this section to the work of the internal audit function include relevant
activities of other functions or third-party providers that have these characteristics.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A45 </b> A practitioner planning to use the work of the internal audit function
to obtain evidence may find it effective and efficient to discuss the planned
use of the work with the internal audit function as a basis for coordinating
activities.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A46 </b> The practitioner has sole responsibility for the opinion expressed,
and that responsibility is not reduced by the practitioner's use of the work of
internal auditors on the engagement. The objectivity and competence of internal
auditors are important in determining whether to use their work and, if so,
the nature and extent of the use of their work. However, a high degree of objectivity
cannot compensate for a low degree of competence, nor can a high degree
of competence compensate for a low degree of objectivity. Additionally, neither
a high level of competence nor strong support for the objectivity of the internal
auditors compensates for the lack of a systematic and disciplined approach
when using the work of the internal audit function</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Evaluating the Results of Procedures (Ref: par. .45–.46)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A47 </b> Uncorrected misstatements are accumulated during the engagement
for the purpose of evaluating whether, individually or in aggregate, they are
material when forming the practitioner's opinion. (See also paragraph .59b)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A48 </b>"Clearly trivial" is not another expression for "not material." Matters
that are clearly trivial will be of a wholly different (smaller) order of magnitude
than materiality and will be matters that are clearly inconsequential, whether
taken individually or in the aggregate and whether judged by any criteria of
size, nature, or circumstances. When there is any uncertainty about whether
one or more items are clearly trivial, the matter is considered not to be clearly
trivial.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A49 </b>Sufficient appropriate evidence is necessary to support the practitioner's
opinion and report. It is cumulative in nature and is primarily obtained
from procedures performed during the course of the engagement. It may,
however, also include information obtained from other sources such as previous
engagements (provided the practitioner has determined whether changes
have occurred since the previous engagement that may affect its relevance to
the current engagement) or a firm's quality control procedures for client acceptance
and continuance. Evidence may come from sources inside and outside
the appropriate party(ies). Also, information that may be used as evidence
may have been prepared by a specialist employed or engaged by the appropriate
party(ies). Evidence comprises both information that supports and corroborates
aspects of the subject matter and any information that contradicts aspects
of the subject matter. In addition, in some cases, the absence of information
(for example, refusal by the appropriate party(ies) to provide a requested representation)
is considered by the practitioner and, therefore, also constitutes
evidence.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A50 </b>The sufficiency and appropriateness of evidence are interrelated. Sufficiency
of evidence is the measure of the quantity of evidence. The quantity of
the evidence needed is affected by the risks of material misstatement and also
by the quality of such evidence.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A51 </b>Appropriateness of evidence is the measure of the quality of evidence,
that is, its relevance and reliability in providing support for the practitioner's
opinion. The reliability of evidence is influenced by its source and nature and is
dependent on the individual circumstances under which it is obtained. Generalizations
about the reliability of various kinds of evidence can be made; however,
such generalizations are subject to important exceptions. Even when evidence
is obtained from sources external to the responsible party, circumstances may
exist that could affect its reliability. For example, evidence obtained from an
independent external source may not be reliable if the source is not knowledgeable.
Recognizing that exceptions may exist, the following generalizations
about the reliability of evidence may be useful:
<ul>
	<li>Evidence is more reliable when it is obtained from independent
sources outside the appropriate party(ies).</li>
	<li>Evidence that is generated internally is more reliable when the
related controls are effective.</li>
	<li>Evidence obtained directly by the practitioner (for example, observation
of the application of a control) is more reliable than evidence
obtained indirectly or by inference (for example, inquiry
about the application of a control).</li>
	<li>Evidence is more reliable when it exists in documentary form,
whether paper, electronic, or other media (for example, a contemporaneously
written record of a meeting is ordinarily more reliable
than a subsequent oral representation of what was discussed).</li>
	<li>Evidence provided by original documents is more reliable than
evidence provided by photocopies, facsimiles, or documents that
have been filmed, digitized, or otherwise transformed into electronic
form, the reliability of which may depend on the controls
over their preparation and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A52 </b>Evidence obtained from different sources or of a different nature ordinarily
provides more assurance than evidence from items considered individually.
In addition, obtaining evidence from different sources or of a different
nature may indicate that an individual item of evidence is not reliable. For example,
corroborating information obtained from a source independent of the
responsible party may increase the assurance the practitioner obtains from a
representation from the responsible party. Conversely, when evidence obtained
from one source is inconsistent with that obtained from another, the practitioner
determines what additional procedures are necessary to resolve the inconsistency</p>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A56 </b> If the responsible party refuses to disclose a subsequent event for
which disclosure is necessary to prevent users of the practitioner's report from
being misled, appropriate actions the practitioner may take include
<ul>
	<li>disclosing the event in the practitioner's report and modifying the
practitioner's opinion.</li>
	<li>withdrawing from the engagement.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A57 </b> Subsequent to the date of the practitioner's report, the practitioner
may become aware of facts that, had they been known to the practitioner at
that date, may have caused the practitioner to revise the report. In such circumstances,
the practitioner undertakes to determine whether the facts existed at
the date of the report and, if so, whether persons who would attach importance
to these facts are currently using, or are likely to use, the report and related
subject matter or assertion. This may include discussing the matter with the
appropriate party(ies) and requesting the appropriate party(ies)'s cooperation
in whatever investigation or further action that may be necessary. The specific
actions to be taken in a particular case by the appropriate party(ies) and the
practitioner may vary with the circumstances. Consideration may be given to, among other things, the time elapsed since the date of the report and whether
issuance of a subsequent report is imminent. The practitioner may need to perform
additional procedures deemed necessary to determine whether the subject
matter or assertion needs revision and whether the previously issued report
continues to be appropriate.</p>
 <p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A58 </b> Depending on the circumstances, the practitioner may determine
that notification of the situation by the appropriate party(ies) to persons who
would attach importance to the facts and who are currently using, or are likely
to use, the practitioner's report is necessary. This may be the case, for example,
when
<ol type="a">
	<li> the report is not to be relied upon because the subject matter or
assertion needs revision or the practitioner is unable to determine
whether revision is necessary, and</li>
	<li>issuance of a subsequent report is not imminent</li>
</ol>
<p>If the appropriate party(ies) failed to take the necessary steps to prevent reliance
on the report, the practitioner's course of action depends upon the practitioner's
legal and ethical rights and obligations. Consequently, the practitioner
may consider it appropriate to seek legal advice prior to making any disclosure
of the situation. Disclosure of the situation directly by the practitioner may
include a description of the nature of the matter and its effect on the subject
matter or assertion and the report, avoiding comments concerning the conduct
or motives of any person.

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A84 </b> The practitioner may decide to more fully describe the practitioner's
responsibility, for example, to
<ul>
	<li>perform procedures to obtain evidence based on the practitioner's
assessment of the risk of material misstatement about whether
the subject matter is presented in accordance with (or based on)
the criteria.
</li>
	<li>obtain an understanding of internal control over the subject matter</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A85 </b> A practitioner may be requested to provide in a separate section of
the practitioner's report a description of the procedures performed and the results
thereof in support of the practitioner's opinion. The following factors are
relevant when determining whether to include such a description in the report:
<ul>
	<li>Whether such a description is likely to overshadow the practitioner's
overall opinion or cause report users to misunderstand
the opinion
</li>
	<li>Whether the parties making the request have an appropriate business
need or reasonable basis for requesting the information (for
example, the specified parties are required to maintain and monitor
controls that either encompass or are dependent on controls
that are the subject of an examination and, therefore, need information
about the tests of controls to enable them to have a basis
for concluding that they have met the requirements applicable to
them)</li>
	<li>Whether the parties have an understanding of the nature and subject
matter of the engagement and experience in using the information
in such reports</li>
	<li>Whether the practitioner's procedures performed directly relate
to the subject matter of the engagement</li>
</ul>
<p>The addition of procedures performed and the results thereof in a separate
section of an examination report may increase the potential for the report to be
misunderstood when taken out of the context of the knowledge of the requesting
parties. This potential for an increase in the risk of misunderstanding may lead
the practitioner to add a restricted-use paragraph to the practitioner's report.</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <i>Inherent Limitations (Ref: par. .63h)</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A86 </b> In some cases, identification of specific inherent limitations is required
by an AT-C section. For example, section 305, Prospective Financial Information,
requires that the practitioner's report include a statement indicating
that the prospective results may not be achieved.4 To implement that requirement,
the illustrative practitioner's examination report on a forecast in section
305 states, "There will usually be differences between the forecasted and actual
results because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected,
and those differences may be material."5 When not explicitly required by an
AT-C section, identification in the report of inherent limitations is based on the
practitioner's judgment</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <i>Opinion (Ref: par. .63i)</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A87 </b> The practitioner's opinion can be worded either in terms of the subject
matter and the criteria (for example, "In our opinion, the schedule of investment
returns of XYZ Company for the year ended December 31, 20XX, is
in accordance with [or based on] the ABC criteria set forth in Note 1, in all
material respects."), or in terms of an assertion made by the responsible party
(for example, "In our opinion, management's assertion that the accompanying
schedule of investment returns of XYZ Company for the year ended December
31, 20XX, is presented in accordance with [or based on] the ABC criteria set
forth in Note 1 is fairly stated, in all material respects.").</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A88 </b> The language of the practitioner's opinion in paragraph .63i(i) may
need to be tailored to reflect the nature of the subject matter and criteria for the
engagement. Examples of language that meet the requirements in paragraph
.63i(i) include the following:
<ul>
	<li>The entity maintained effective internal control over the subject
matter, in all material respects, based on the criteria.</li>
	<li>The subject matter is presented in accordance with (or based on)
the criteria, in all material respects.</li>
	<li>The subject matter achieved the objectives, in all material respects
(when the objectives are the criteria).</li>
	<li>The subject matter is free from material misstatement based on
the criteria.</li>
	<li>The subject matter is presented fairly, in all material respects,
based on the criteria. (The practitioner's professional judgment
concerning the fairness of the presentation of the subject matter
relates to whether the measurement, recognition, presentation,
and disclosure of all material items in the presentation of the subject
matter achieve fair presentation.)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A89 </b> A single practitioner's report may cover more than one aspect of a
subject matter or an assertion about the subject matter. When that is the case,
the report may contain separate opinions or conclusions on each aspect of the
subject matter or assertion (for example, examination level related to some aspects
or assertions and review level related to others, or an unmodified opinion
on some aspects or assertions and a modified opinion on others).</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A90 </b> A practitioner may report on subject matter or an assertion at multiple
dates or covering multiple periods during which criteria have changed
(for example, a practitioner's report on comparative information). Criteria are
clearly described when they identify the criteria for each period and how the
criteria have changed from one period to the next. If the criteria for the current
date or period have changed from the criteria for a preceding date or period,
changes in the criteria may be significant to users of the report. If so, the criteria
and the fact that they have changed may be disclosed in the presentation of
the subject matter, in the written assertion, or in the report, even if the subject
matter for the preceding date or period is not presented.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <i>Location (Ref: par. .63k)</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A91 </b> In the United States, the location of the issuing office is the city and
state. In another country, it may be the city and country.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <i>Date (Ref: par. .63l)</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A92 </b> Including the date of the practitioner's report informs the intended
users that the practitioner has considered the effect of the events that occurred
up to that date on the subject matter and the report.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A93 </b> Because the practitioner expresses an opinion on the subject matter
or assertion and the subject matter or assertion is the responsibility of the responsible
party, the practitioner is not in a position to conclude that sufficient
appropriate evidence has been obtained until evidence is obtained that all the
elements that the subject matter or assertion comprises, including any related
notes, when applicable, have been prepared, and the responsible party has accepted
responsibility for them.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <i>Restricted-Use Paragraph (Ref: par. .10, .50, .64, and .65b–c)</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A94 </b> A practitioner's report for which the conditions in paragraph .64 do
not apply need not include an alert that restricts its use. However, nothing in
the attestation standards precludes a practitioner from including such an alert
in any practitioner's report or other practitioner's written communication.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A95 </b> A practitioner's report that is required by paragraph .64 to include an
alert that restricts the use of the report may be included in a document that also
contains a practitioner's report that is for general use. In such circumstances,
the use of the general use report is not affected.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A96 </b> A practitioner may also issue a single combined practitioner's report
that includes (a) a practitioner's report that is required by paragraph .64 to
include an alert that restricts its use, and (b) a report that is for general use. If
these two types of reports are clearly differentiated within the combined report,
such as through the use of appropriate headings, the alert that restricts the use
of the report may be limited to the report required by paragraph .64 to include
such an alert. In such circumstances, the use of the general use report is not
affected.</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A97 </b> The written representations required by paragraph .50 include an
assertion. If the engaging party is not the responsible party and the responsible
party provides an oral assertion rather than a written assertion, paragraph
.64c calls for an alert that restricts the use of the practitioner's report to the
engaging party</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A98 </b> The practitioner may identify the specified parties by naming them,
referring to a list of those parties, or identifying the class of parties, for example,
"all customers of XYZ Company during some or all of the period January 1,
20XX to December 31, 20XX." The method of identifying the specified parties
is determined by the practitioner</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A99 </b> In some cases, the criteria used to measure or evaluate the subject
matter may be designed for a specific purpose. For example, a regulator may
require certain entities to use particular criteria designed for regulatory purposes.
To avoid misunderstandings, the practitioner alerts users of the practitioner's
report to this fact and, therefore, that the report is intended solely for
the information and use of the specified parties.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A100 </b> The alert that restricts the use of the practitioner's report is designed
to avoid misunderstandings related to the use of the report, particularly
if the report is taken out of the context in which the report is intended to be
used. A practitioner may consider informing the responsible party and, if different,
the engaging party or other specified parties that the report is not intended
for distribution to parties other than those specified in the report. The
practitioner may, in connection with establishing the terms of the engagement,
reach an understanding with the responsible party or, if different, the engaging
party, that the intended use of the report will be restricted and may obtain the
responsible party's agreement that the responsible party and specified parties
will not distribute such report to parties other than those identified therein. A
practitioner is not responsible for controlling, and cannot control, distribution
of the report after its release.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A101 </b> In some cases, a restricted-use practitioner's report filed with regulatory
agencies is required by law or regulation to be made available to the
public as a matter of public record. Also, a regulatory agency, as part of its oversight
responsibility for an entity, may require access to a restricted-use report
in which it is not named as a specified party.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <i>Reference to the Practitioner’s Specialist (Ref: par. .67)</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A102 </b> The practitioner has sole responsibility for the opinion expressed,
and that responsibility is not reduced by the practitioner's use of the work of a
practitioner's specialist.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <i>Modified Opinions (Ref: par. .68, .70, and .74)
</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A103 </b> The three types of modified opinions are a qualified opinion, an adverse
opinion, and a disclaimer of opinion. The decision regarding which type
of modified opinion is appropriate depends upon the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The nature of the matter giving rise to the modification (that is,
whether the subject matter of the engagement is in accordance
with [or based on] the criteria, in all material respects or, in the
case of an inability to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence, may
be materially misstated)</li>
	<li>The practitioner's professional judgment about the pervasiveness
of the effects or possible effects of the matter on the subject matter
of the engagement
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A104 </b> A practitioner may express an unmodified opinion only when the
engagement has been conducted in accordance with the attestation standards.
Such standards will not have been complied with if the practitioner has been
unable to apply all the procedures that the practitioner considers necessary in
the circumstances.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A105 </b> The term pervasive describes the effects on the subject matter of
misstatements or the possible effects on the subject matter of misstatements,
if any, that are undetected due to an inability to obtain sufficient appropriate
evidence. Pervasive effects on the subject matter are those that, in the practitioner's
professional judgment
<ol type="a">
	<li>are not confined to specific aspects of the subject matter;</li>
	<li>. if so confined, represent or could represent a substantial proportion
of the subject matter; or</li>
	<li>in relation to disclosures, are fundamental to the intended users'
understanding of the subject matter.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A106 </b> The following table illustrates how the practitioner's professional
judgment about the nature of the matter giving rise to the modification and
the pervasiveness of its effects or possible effects on the subject matter affects
the type of practitioner's report to be issued.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A107 </b> A scope limitation may arise from the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>Circumstances beyond the control of the appropriate party(ies).
For example, documentation that the practitioner considers necessary
to inspect may have been accidentally destroyed.</li>
	<li>Circumstances relating to the nature or timing of the practitioner's
work. For example, a physical process that the practitioner
considers necessary to observe may have occurred before
the practitioner's engagement</li>
	<li>Limitations imposed by the responsible party or the engaging
party on the practitioner that, for example, may prevent the
practitioner from performing a procedure that the practitioner considers necessary in the circumstances. Limitations of this kind
may have other implications for the engagement, such as for the
practitioner's consideration of risks of material misstatement and
engagement acceptance and continuance.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A108 </b> The inability to obtain written representations from the responsible
party ordinarily would result in a scope limitation. However, when the engaging
party is not the responsible party, paragraph .51 enables the practitioner to
make inquiries of the responsible party and if the responsible party's oral responses
enable the practitioner to conclude that the practitioner has sufficient
appropriate evidence to form an opinion about the subject matter, paragraph
.56a indicates this would not cause a scope limitation. Further, paragraph .56a
requires that the practitioner's report in these circumstances contain an alert
paragraph that restricts the use of the report to the engaging party</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A109 </b> The practitioner's decision to express a qualified opinion, disclaim
an opinion, or withdraw from the engagement because of a scope limitation
depends on an assessment of the effect of the omitted procedure(s) on the practitioner's
ability to express an opinion. This assessment will be affected by the
nature and magnitude of the potential effects of the matters in question and by
their significance to the subject matter or assertion.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A110 </b> An inability to perform a specific procedure does not constitute a
scope limitation if the practitioner is able to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence
by performing alternative procedures.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Responsible Party Refuses to Provide a Written Assertion
(Ref: par. .84)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A111 </b> The following is an example of the disclosure required by paragraph.84:</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A112 </b> The practitioner's report discussed in paragraph .84 is appropriate
only when the engagement is to report on the subject matter; it is not appropriate
for a report on an assertion. When reporting on an assertion, the practitioner
is required to obtain a written assertion from the responsible party.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A113 </b> If the responsible party's failure to provide the practitioner with
written representations causes the practitioner to conclude that a scope limitation
exists and, thus, qualify or disclaim an opinion, the practitioner need
not restrict the use of the practitioner's report but is required by paragraph .69
to describe the matter that gave rise to the modified opinion. Paragraph .A94
notes, however, that the practitioner is not precluded from restricting the use
of any report.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Communication Responsibilities (Ref: par. .85–.86)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A114 </b> Other matters that may be appropriate to communicate to the responsible
party or, if different, the engaging party, include bias in the measurement,
evaluation, or disclosure of the subject matter. (Ref: par. .85)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A115 </b> The practitioner's professional duty to maintain the confidentiality
of client information may preclude the practitioner from reporting identified or
suspected noncompliance with laws or regulations that is not relevant to the subject matter to a party other than the responsible party and, if different, the
engaging party. However, the practitioner's legal responsibilities may vary by
jurisdiction, and in certain circumstances, the duty of confidentiality may be
overridden by statute, the law, or courts of law. In the following circumstances,
a duty to notify parties outside the entity may exist:
<ul>
	<li>In response to a court order</li>
	<li>In compliance with requirements for examinations of entities that
receive financial assistance from a government agency</li>
</ul>
<p>Because potential conflicts with the practitioner's ethical and legal obligations
for confidentiality may be complex, the practitioner may consult with legal
counsel before discussing noncompliance with parties outside the entity. (Ref:
par. .86)</p>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A116 </b> If the practitioner is performing an examination engagement in accordance
with Government Auditing Standards, the practitioner may be required
to report on compliance with laws, regulations, and provisions of contracts
or grant agreements as part of the examination. The practitioner also
may be required to communicate instances of noncompliance to appropriate
oversight bodies and funding agencies. (Ref: par. .86)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Documentation (Ref: par. .87)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A117 </b> Documentation includes a record of the practitioner's reasoning on
all significant findings or issues that require the exercise of professional judgment
and related conclusions. The existence of difficult questions of principle or
professional judgment calls for the documentation to include the relevant facts
that were known by the practitioner at the time the conclusion was reached.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A118 </b> It is neither necessary nor practical to document every matter considered,
or professional judgment made, during an engagement. Further, it is
unnecessary for the practitioner to document separately (as in a checklist, for
example) compliance with matters for which compliance is demonstrated by
documents included in the engagement file. Similarly, the practitioner need not
include in the engagement file superseded drafts of working papers, notes that
reflect incomplete or preliminary thinking, previous copies of documents corrected
for typographical or other errors, and duplicates of documents.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A119 </b> In applying professional judgment to assess the extent of documentation
to be prepared and retained, the practitioner may consider what is necessary
to provide an experienced practitioner, having no previous connection
with the engagement, with an understanding of the work performed and the
basis of the principal decisions made.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A120 </b> Documentation ordinarily includes a record of
<ul>
	<li>issues identified with respect to compliance with relevant ethical
requirements and how they were resolved.</li>
	<li>conclusions on compliance with independence requirements that
apply to the engagement and any relevant discussions with the
firm that support these conclusions</li>

<p>
<p>The following is an illustrative practitioner's report for an examination engagement
in which the practitioner expresses a qualified opinion because conditions exist that, individually or in combination, result in one or more material, but
not pervasive, misstatements of the subject matter based on (or in certain engagements,
deviations from, exceptions to, or instances of noncompliance with)
the criteria. The practitioner has examined the subject matter and is reporting
on the subject matter. Paragraph .79 states, "If the practitioner has concluded
that conditions exist that, individually or in combination, result in one or more
material misstatements based on the criteria, the practitioner should modify
the opinion and should express a qualified or adverse opinion directly on the
subject matter, not on the assertion, even when the assertion acknowledges the
misstatement."
