<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Other Presentation Matters Section provides guidance on other presentation matters not addressed in the Recognition, Initial Measurement, Subsequent Measurement,and Derecognition Sections.  Other presentation matters may include items such as current or long-term balance sheet classification, cash flow presentation, earnings per share matters, and so forth.  The FASB Codification also contains Presentation Topics, which provide guidance for general presentation and display items.  See those Topics for general guidance.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General</b>
</p><p id="95845">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-1</b>  Resources received in exchange transactions shall be classified as unrestricted revenues and net assets, even in circumstances in which resource providers place limitations on the use of the resources.  For example, resources received from governments in exchange transactions in which those governments have placed limitations on the use of the resources shall be reported as unrestricted revenues and net assets, because those limitations are not donor-imposed restrictions on contributions.  See paragraph 958-210-50-2 for additional information about significant contractual limitations.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-2</b>  If the not-for-profit entity (NFP) regularly provides discounts (such as financial aid for students that is not reported as an expense, reduced fees for services, or free services) to certain recipients of its goods and services, revenues shall be reported net of those discounts (see also paragraphs 958-720-25-7 and 958-720-45-23).  Net revenue may be reported as a single line item in a statement of activities, or the gross revenue is permitted to be reported less the related discount, provided that the discount is displayed immediately beneath the revenue.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contributions Received</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-3</b>
Contributions received by not-for-profit entities (NFPs) shall be reported as restricted support or unrestricted support.  an NFP shall distinguish between contributions received with permanent restrictions, those received with temporary restrictions, and those received without donor-imposed restrictions.  contributions without donor-imposed restrictions shall be reported as unrestricted support that increases unrestricted net assets.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4</b>  Restricted support increases permanently restricted net assets or temporarily restricted net assets.  A restriction on an NFP's use of the assets contributed results either from a donor's explicit stipulation or form circumstances surrounding the receipt if the contribution that make clear the donor's implicit restriction on use.  Contributions with donor-imposed restrictions shall be reported as restricted support; however, donor-restricted contributions whose restrictions are met in the same reporting period may be reported as unrestricted support provided that an NFP has a similar policy for reporting investment gains and income (see paragraph 958-320-45-3), reports consistently from period to period, and discloses its accounting policy.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-5</b>  Receipts of unconditional promises to give with payments due in future periods shall be reported as restricted support unless explicit donor stipulations or circumstances surrounding the receipt of a promise make clear that the donor intended it to to be used ot support activities of the current period.  It is reasonable to assume that by specifying future payment dates donors indicate that their gift is to support activities in each period in which a payment is scheduled.  For example, receipts of unconditional promises to give cash in future years generally increase temporarily restricted net assets.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-6</b>  Gifts of long-lived assets received without stipulations about how long the donated asset must be used shall be reported as restricted support it is is and NFP's accounting policy to imply a time restriction that expires over the useful life of the donated assets.  NFPs that adopt a policy of implying time restrictions also shall imply a time restriction on long-lived assets acquired with gifts of cash or other asset restricted for those acquisitions.  In the absence of that policy and other donor-imposed restrictions on use of the asset, gifts of long-lived assets shall be reported as unrestricted support.  (Pursuant to paragraph 954-205-45-9,not-for-profit health care entities are not permitted to imply a time restriction that expires over the useful life of a long-lived asset.)
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-7</b>  Pursuant to paragraph 958-225-45-3, reclassifications for expirations of donor-imposed restrictions are reported separately from other transactions.
