<P class="p2 ft3">Introduction</P>
<P class="p3 ft5">.01 The auditor's report contains either an expression of opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS3105.aspx#_ftn1"><SPAN class="ft4">1</SPAN></A> or an assertion that an opinion cannot be expressed. This standard discusses the circumstances that may require the auditor to depart from the auditor's unqualified report<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS3105.aspx#_ftn2"><SPAN class="ft4">2</SPAN></A> and provides reporting guidance in the following circumstances:</P>
<P class="p4 ft5"><SPAN class="ft6"></SPAN><SPAN class="ft7">Qualified opinion</SPAN>. A qualified opinion states that, except for the effects of the matter(s) to which the qualification relates, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the entity in conformity with generally accepted accounting</P>
<P class="p5 ft9">principles. <SPAN class="ft8">See </SPAN><NOBR>paragraphs .02–.39.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p6 ft12"><SPAN class="ft6"></SPAN><SPAN class="ft10">Adverse opinion</SPAN>. An adverse opinion states that the financial statements do not present fairly the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the entity in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. <SPAN class="ft11">See </SPAN>paragraphs</P>

<P class="p12 ft5">.02 Certain circumstances may require a qualified opinion. A qualified opinion states that, <SPAN class="ft11">except for </SPAN>the effects of the matter to which the qualification relates, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Such an opinion is expressed when—</P>
<P class="p13 ft5"><SPAN class="ft19">a.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">There is a lack of sufficient appropriate evidential matter or there are restrictions on the scope of the audit that have led the auditor to conclude that he or she cannot express an unqualified opinion and he or she has concluded not to disclaim an opinion </SPAN><NOBR>(paragraphs .05–.17).</NOBR></P>
<P class="p14 ft5"><SPAN class="ft19">b.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">The auditor believes, on the basis of his or her audit, that the financial statements contain a departure from generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of which is material, and he or she has concluded not to express an adverse opinion </SPAN><NOBR>(paragraphs .18–.39).</NOBR></P>
<P class="p15 ft5">.03 When the auditor expresses a qualified opinion, the auditor's report must include the same basic elements and communication of critical audit matters, if requirements of critical audit matters apply, as would be required in an unqualified auditor's report under AS 3101.</P>
<P class="p16 ft5">.04 When the auditor expresses a qualified opinion, he or she should disclose all of the substantive reasons for the qualified opinion in one or more separate paragraph(s) immediately following the opinion paragraph of the auditor's report. The auditor should also include, in the opinion paragraph, the appropriate qualifying language and a reference to the paragraph that discloses all of the substantive reasons for the qualified opinion. A qualified opinion should include the word <SPAN class="ft11">except </SPAN>or <SPAN class="ft11">exception </SPAN>in a phrase such as <SPAN class="ft11">except for </SPAN>or <SPAN class="ft11">with the exception of</SPAN>. Phrases such as <SPAN class="ft11">subject to </SPAN>and <SPAN class="ft11">with the foregoing explanation </SPAN>are not clear or forceful enough and should not be used. Since accompanying notes are part of the financial statements, wording such as <SPAN class="ft11">fairly presented, in all material respects, when read in conjunction with Note 1 </SPAN>is likely to be misunderstood and should not be used.</P>
<P class="p17 ft12">Note: The auditor should refer to AS 3101 to determine if the matter for which the auditor qualified the opinion is also a critical audit matter.</P>

<P class="p1 ft21">Scope Limitations</P>
<P class="p18 ft5">.05 The auditor can determine that he or she is able to express an unqualified opinion only if the audit has been conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and if he or she has therefore been able to apply all the procedures he considers necessary in the circumstances. Restrictions on the scope of the audit, whether imposed by the client or by circumstances, such as the timing of his or her work, the inability to obtain sufficient appropriate evidential matter, or an inadequacy in the accounting records, may require the auditor to qualify his or her opinion or to disclaim an opinion. In such instances, the reasons for the auditor's qualification of opinion or disclaimer of opinion should be described in the report.</P>
<P class="p19 ft5">.06 The auditor's decision to qualify his or her opinion or disclaim an opinion because of a scope limitation depends on his or her assessment of the importance of the omitted procedure(s) to his or her ability to form an opinion on the financial statements being audited. This assessment will be affected by the nature and magnitude of the potential effects of the matters in question and by their significance to the financial statements. If the potential effects relate to many financial statement items, this significance is likely to be greater than if only a limited number of items is involved.</P>
<P class="p20 ft23">.07 Common restrictions on the scope of the audit include those applying to the observation of physical inventories and the confirmation of accounts receivable by direct communication with debtors.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS3105.aspx#_ftn3"><SPAN class="ft22">3</SPAN></A> Another common scope restriction involves accounting for <NOBR>long-term</NOBR> investments when the auditor has not been able to obtain audited financial statements of an investee. Restrictions on the application of these or other audit procedures to important elements of the financial statements require the auditor to decide whether he or she has examined sufficient appropriate evidential matter to permit him or her to express an unqualified or qualified opinion, or whether he or she should disclaim an opinion. When restrictions that significantly limit the scope of the audit are imposed by the client, ordinarily the auditor should disclaim an opinion on the financial statements.</P>
<P class="p21 ft12">.08 When a qualified opinion results from a limitation on the scope of the audit or an insufficiency of evidential matter, the auditor's report should describe the basis for</P>

<DIV id="id4_1">
<P class="p22 ft5">departure from an unqualified opinion in a separate paragraph immediately following the opinion paragraph and refer to that description in both the Basis for Opinion section and opinion paragraph of the auditor's report. It is not appropriate for the scope of the audit to be explained in a note to the financial statements, since the description of the audit scope is the responsibility of the auditor and not that of the client.</P>
<P class="p23 ft5">.09 When an auditor qualifies his or her opinion because of a scope limitation, the wording in the opinion paragraph should indicate that the qualification pertains to the possible effects on the financial statements and not to the scope limitation itself. Wording such as "In our opinion, except for the <NOBR>above-mentioned</NOBR> limitation on the scope of our audit . . ." bases the exception on the restriction itself, rather than on the possible effects on the financial statements and, therefore, is unacceptable. An example of a qualified opinion related to a scope limitation concerning an investment in a foreign affiliate (assuming the effects of the limitation are such that the auditor has concluded that a disclaimer of opinion is not appropriate) follows:</P>

In our opinion, except for the effects of the adjustments, if any, as might have been determined to be necessary had we been able to examine evidence regarding the foreign affiliate investment and earnings, as described below, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>

<P class="p37 ft5">.10 <SPAN class="ft25">Other scope limitations. </SPAN>Sometimes, notes to financial statements may contain unaudited information, such as pro forma calculations or other similar disclosures. If the unaudited information (for example, an investor's share, material in amount, of an investee's earnings recognized on the equity method) is such that it should be subjected to auditing procedures in order for the auditor to form an opinion with respect to the financial statements taken as a whole, the auditor should apply the procedures he or she deems necessary to the unaudited information. If the auditor has not been able to apply the procedures he or she considers necessary, the auditor should qualify his or her opinion or disclaim an opinion because of a limitation on the scope of the audit.</P>
<P class="p38 ft5">.11 If, however, these disclosures are not necessary to fairly present the financial position, operating results, or cash flows on which the auditor is reporting, such disclosures may be identified as <SPAN class="ft11">unaudited </SPAN>or as <SPAN class="ft11">not covered by the auditor's report</SPAN>. For example, the pro forma effects of a business combination or of a subsequent event may be labelled unaudited. Therefore, while the event or transaction giving rise to the disclosures in these circumstances should be audited, the pro forma disclosures of that event or transaction would not be. The auditor should be aware, however, that AS 3110<SPAN class="ft11">, Dating of the Independent Auditor's Report, </SPAN>states that, if the auditor is aware of a material subsequent event that has occurred after the completion of fieldwork but before issuance of the report that should be disclosed, the auditor's only options are to dual date the report or date the report as of the date of the subsequent event and extend the procedures for review of subsequent events to that date.

Uncertainties include, but are not limited to, contingencies covered by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, <SPAN class="ft11">Accounting for Contingencies</SPAN>, and matters related to estimates covered by Statement of Position 94- 6, <SPAN class="ft11">Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p40 ft27">.13 Conclusive evidential matter concerning the ultimate outcome of uncertainties cannot be expected to exist at the time of the audit because the outcome and related evidential matter are prospective. In these circumstances, management is responsible for estimating the effect of future events on the financial statements, or determining that a reasonable estimate cannot be made and making the required disclosures, all in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, based on management's analysis of existing conditions. An audit includes an assessment of whether the evidential matter is sufficient to support management's analysis. Absence of the existence of information related to the outcome of an uncertainty does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the evidential matter supporting management's assertion is not sufficient. Rather, the auditor's judgment regarding the sufficiency of the evidential matter is based on the evidential matter that is, or should be, available. If, after considering the existing conditions and available evidence, the auditor concludes that sufficient evidential matter supports management's assertions about the nature of a matter involving an uncertainty and its presentation or disclosure in the financial statements, an unqualified opinion ordinarily is appropriate.</P>
<P class="p41 ft5">.14 If the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient evidential matter to support management's assertions about the nature of a matter involving an uncertainty and its presentation or disclosure in the financial statements, the auditor should consider the need to express a qualified opinion or to disclaim an opinion because of a scope limitation. A qualification or disclaimer of opinion because of a scope limitation is appropriate if sufficient evidential matter related to an uncertainty does or did exist but was not available to the auditor for reasons such as management's record retention policies or a restriction imposed by management.</P>

Such departures may be caused by inadequate disclosure concerning the uncertainty, the use of inappropriate accounting principles, or the use of unreasonable accounting estimates. Paragraphs .28 to .32 provide guidance to the auditor when financial statements contain departures from generally accepted accounting principles related to uncertainties.</P>
<P class="p44 ft5">.16 <SPAN class="ft25">Limited reporting engagements. </SPAN>The auditor may be asked to report on one basic financial statement and not on the others. For example, he or she may be asked to report on the balance sheet and not on the statements of income, retained earnings or cash flows. These engagements do not involve scope limitations if the auditor's access to information underlying the basic financial statements is not limited and if the auditor applies all the procedures he considers necessary in the circumstances; rather, such engagements involve limited reporting objectives.</P>
<P class="p45 ft5">.17 An auditor may be asked to report on the balance sheet only. In this case, the auditor may express an opinion on the balance sheet only.

<P class="p1 ft5">.18 When financial statements are materially affected by a departure from generally accepted accounting principles and the auditor has audited the statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, he or she should express a qualified (paragraphs .19 through .39) or an adverse (paragraphs .40 through .43) opinion. The basis for such opinion should be stated in the report.</P>
<P class="p53 ft23">.19 In deciding whether the effects of a departure from generally accepted accounting principles are sufficiently material to require either a qualified or adverse opinion, one factor to be considered is the dollar magnitude of such effects. However, the concept of materiality does not depend entirely on relative size; it involves qualitative as well as quantitative judgments. The significance of an item to a particular entity (for example, inventories to a manufacturing company), the pervasiveness of the misstatement (such as whether it affects the amounts and presentation of numerous financial statement items), and the effect of the misstatement on the financial statements taken as a whole are all factors to be considered in making a judgment regarding materiality.</P>
<P class="p54 ft5">.20 When the auditor expresses a qualified opinion, he or she should disclose, in a separate paragraph(s) immediately following the opinion paragraph, all of the substantive reasons that have led him or her to conclude that there has been a departure from generally accepted accounting principles. Furthermore, the opinion paragraph should include the appropriate qualifying language and a reference to the paragraph(s) that describe the substantive reasons for the qualified opinion.</P>
<P class="p55 ft5">.21 The paragraph(s) immediately following the opinion paragraph that describe the substantive reasons that led the auditor to conclude that there has been a departure from generally accepted accounting principles should also disclose the principal effects of the subject matter of the qualification on financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, if practicable.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS3105.aspx#_ftn4"><SPAN class="ft29">4</SPAN></A> If the effects are not reasonably determinable, the report should so state. If such disclosures are made in a note to the financial statements, the paragraph(s) that describe the substantive reasons for the qualified opinion may be shortened by referring to it.</P>

FASB Statement No. 5, <SPAN class="ft11">Accounting for Contingencies</SPAN>, paragraphs 23 and 25, describes situations in which the inability to make a reasonable estimate may raise questions about the appropriateness of the accounting principles used. If, in those or other situations, the auditor concludes that the accounting principles used cause the financial statements to be materially misstated, he or she should express a qualified or an adverse opinion.</P>
<P class="p38 ft5">.32 Usually, the auditor is able to satisfy himself or herself regarding the reasonableness of management's estimate of the effects of future events by considering various types of evidential matter, including the historical experience of the entity. If the auditor concludes that management's estimate is unreasonable (<SPAN class="ft11">see </SPAN>paragraph .13 of AS 2810, <SPAN class="ft11">Evaluating Audit Results</SPAN>) and that its effect is to cause the financial statements to be materially misstated, he or she should express a qualified or an adverse opinion.</P>
<P class="p81 ft35"><SPAN class="ft9">.33 </SPAN>Departures from generally accepted accounting principles related to changes in</P>
<P class="p82 ft11"><SPAN class="ft25">accounting principle</SPAN><SPAN class="ft5">. Paragraph .07 of AS 2820, </SPAN>Evaluating Consistency of Financial Statements<SPAN class="ft5">, includes the criteria for evaluating a change in accounting principle. If the auditor concludes that the criteria have not been met, he or she should consider that circumstance to be a departure from generally accepted accounting principles and, if the effect of the accounting change is material, should issue a qualified or adverse opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p21 ft5">.34 The accounting standards indicate that a company may make a change in accounting principle only if it justifies that the allowable alternative accounting principle is preferable. If the company does not provide reasonable justification that the alternative accounting principle is preferable, the auditor should consider the accounting change to be a departure from generally accepted accounting principles and, if the effect of the change in accounting principle is material, should issue a qualified or</P>

<P class="p36 ft9">To the shareholders and the board of directors of X Company</P>
<P class="p26 ft9">Opinion on the Financial Statements</P>
<P class="p85 ft23">We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of X Company (the "Company") as of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, the related statements of [<SPAN class="ft37">titles of the financial statements, e.g., income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows</SPAN>] for each of the years then ended, and the related notes [<SPAN class="ft37">and schedules</SPAN>] (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, except for the change in accounting principle discussed in the following paragraph, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>
<P class="p86 ft5">As disclosed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company adopted, in 20X2, the <NOBR>first-in,</NOBR> <NOBR>first-out</NOBR> method of accounting for its inventories, whereas it previously used the <NOBR>last-in,</NOBR> <NOBR>first-out</NOBR> method. Although use of the <NOBR>first-in,</NOBR> <NOBR>first-out</NOBR> method is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, in our opinion the Company has not provided reasonable justification that this accounting principle is preferable as required by those principles.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS3105.aspx#_ftn6"><SPAN class="ft4">6</SPAN></A></P>

<P class="p88 ft5">.35 Whenever an accounting change results in an auditor expressing a qualified or adverse opinion on the conformity of financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles for the year of change, the auditor should consider the possible effects of that change when reporting on the entity's financial statements for subsequent years, as discussed in paragraphs .36 through .39.</P>
<P class="p89 ft5">.36 If the financial statements for the year of such change are presented and reported on with a subsequent year's financial statements, the auditor's report should disclose his or her reservations with respect to the statements for the year of change.</P>
<P class="p90 ft5">.37 If an entity has adopted an accounting principle that is not a generally accepted accounting principle, its continued use might have a material effect on the statements of a subsequent year on which the auditor is reporting. In this situation, the independent auditor should express either a qualified opinion or an adverse opinion, depending on the materiality of the departure in relation to the statements of the subsequent year.</P>
<P class="p91 ft5">.38 If an entity accounts for the effect of a change prospectively when generally accepted accounting principles require restatement or the inclusion of the cumulative effect of the change in the year of change, a subsequent year's financial statements could improperly include a charge or credit that is material to those statements. This situation also requires that the auditor express a qualified or an adverse opinion.</P>
<P class="p92 ft5">.39 If the auditor issues a qualified or adverse opinion because the company has not justified that an allowable accounting principle adopted in an accounting change is preferable, as described in paragraph .34, the auditor should continue to express that</P>

However, the auditor's qualified or adverse opinion relates only to the accounting change and does not affect the status of a newly adopted principle as a generally accepted accounting principle. Accordingly, while expressing a qualified or adverse opinion for the year of change, the independent auditor's opinion regarding the subsequent years' statements need not express a qualified or adverse opinion on the use of the newly adopted principle in subsequent periods.</P>
<P class="p36 ft17">Adverse Opinions</P>
<P class="p94 ft27">.40 When the auditor expresses an adverse opinion, the auditor's report must include the opinion as described in paragraph .41 and the same other basic elements as would be required in an unqualified auditor's report under AS 3101, modified appropriately.</P>
<P class="p95 ft12">Note: The requirements as to critical audit matters described in AS 3101 do not apply when the auditor expresses an adverse opinion.</P>

<P class="p36 ft9">To the shareholders and the board of directors of X Company</P>

In our opinion, because of the effects of the matters discussed in the following paragraphs, the financial statements do not present fairly, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, or the results of its operations or its cash flows for the years then ended.</P>
<P class="p98 ft23">As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company carries its property, plant and equipment accounts at appraisal values, and provides depreciation on the basis of such values. Further, the Company does not provide for income taxes with respect to differences between financial income and taxable income arising because of the use, for income tax purposes, of the installment method of reporting gross profit from certain types of sales. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that property, plant and equipment be stated at an amount not in excess of cost, reduced by depreciation based on such amount, and that deferred income taxes be provided.</P>
<P class="p99 ft12">Because of the departures from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America identified above, as of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, inventories have been increased $<SPAN class="ft30">_______ </SPAN>and $<SPAN class="ft30">_______ </SPAN>by inclusion in manufacturing overhead of</P>

When disclaiming an opinion because of a scope limitation, the auditor should state in a separate paragraph or paragraphs all of the substantive reasons for the disclaimer. He or she should state that the scope of the audit was not sufficient to warrant the expression of an opinion. The auditor should not identify the procedures that were performed nor include the paragraph describing the characteristics of an audit (that is, the scope paragraph of the auditor's standard report); to do so may tend to overshadow the disclaimer.

<P class="p132 ft5">.52 If, during the current audit, an auditor becomes aware of circumstances or events that affect the financial statements of a prior period, he or she should consider such matters when updating his or her report on the financial statements of the prior period. For example, if an auditor has previously qualified his or her opinion or expressed an adverse opinion on financial statements of a prior period because of a departure from generally accepted accounting principles, and the <NOBR>prior-period</NOBR> financial statements are restated in the current period to conform with generally accepted accounting principles, the auditor's updated report on the financial statements of the prior period should indicate that the statements have been restated and should express an unqualified opinion with respect to the restated financial statements.</P>
<P class="p99 ft5">.53 If, in an updated report, the opinion is different from the opinion previously expressed on the financial statements of a prior period, the auditor should disclose all the substantive reasons for the different opinion in a separate explanatory paragraph(s) immediately following the opinion paragraph of his or her report. The explanatory paragraph(s) should disclose (<SPAN class="ft11">a</SPAN>) the date of the auditor's previous report, (<SPAN class="ft11">b</SPAN>) the type of opinion previously expressed, (<SPAN class="ft11">c</SPAN>) if applicable, a statement that the previously issued financial statements have been restated for the correction of a misstatement in the respective period, (<SPAN class="ft11">d</SPAN>) the circumstances or events that caused the auditor to express a different opinion, and (<SPAN class="ft11">e</SPAN>) if applicable, a reference to the company's disclosure of the</P>

The following is an example of a report that may be appropriate when an auditor issues an updated report on the financial statements of a prior period that contains an opinion different from the opinion previously expressed:</P>
<P class="p133 ft1">Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</P>
<P class="p36 ft9">To the shareholders and the board of directors of X Company</P>
<P class="p26 ft9">Opinion on the Financial Statements</P>
<P class="p85 ft27">We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of X Company (the "Company") as of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, the related statements of [<SPAN class="ft28">titles of the financial statements, e.g., income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows</SPAN>] for each of the years then ended, and the related notes [<SPAN class="ft28">and schedules</SPAN>] (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>
<P class="p134 ft5">In our report dated March 1, 20X2, we expressed an opinion that the 20X1 financial statements did not fairly present financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America because of two departures from such principles: (1) the Company carried its property, plant, and equipment at appraisal values, and provided for depreciation on the basis of such values, and (2) the Company did not provide for deferred income taxes with respect to differences between income for financial reporting purposes and taxable income. As described in Note X, the Company has changed its method of accounting for these items and restated its 20X1 financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accordingly, our present opinion on the 20X1 financial statements, as presented herein, is different from that expressed in our previous report.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS3105.aspx#_ftn15"><SPAN class="ft29">15</SPAN></A></P>

<P class="p2 ft17">Report of Predecessor Auditor</P>
<P class="p135 ft5">.54 A predecessor auditor ordinarily would be in a position to reissue his or her report on the financial statements of a prior period at the request of a former client if he or she is able to make satisfactory arrangements with the former client to perform this service and if he or she performs the procedures described in paragraph .55.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS3105.aspx#_ftn16"><SPAN class="ft4">16</SPAN></A></P>
<P class="p2 ft21">Predecessor Auditor's Report Reissued</P>
<P class="p136 ft5">.55 Before reissuing (or consenting to the reuse of) a report previously issued on the financial statements of a prior period, when those financial statements are to be presented on a comparative basis with audited financial statements of a subsequent period, a predecessor auditor should consider whether his or her previous report on those statements is still appropriate. Either the current form or manner of presentation of the financial statements of the prior period or one or more subsequent events might make a predecessor auditor's previous report inappropriate. Consequently, a predecessor auditor should (<SPAN class="ft11">a</SPAN>) read the financial statements of the current period, (<SPAN class="ft11">b</SPAN>) compare the <NOBR>prior-period</NOBR> financial statements that he or she reported on with the financial statements to be presented for comparative purposes, and (<SPAN class="ft11">c</SPAN>) obtain</P>

The representation letter from management of the former client should state (<SPAN class="ft11">a</SPAN>) whether any information has come to management's attention that would cause them to believe that any of the previous representations should be modified, and (<SPAN class="ft11">b</SPAN>) whether any events have occurred subsequent to the <NOBR>balance-sheet</NOBR> date of the latest prior- period financial statements reported on by the predecessor auditor that would require adjustment to or disclosure in those financial statements.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS3105.aspx#_ftn17"><SPAN class="ft29">17</SPAN></A> The representation letter from the successor auditor should state whether the successor's audit revealed any matters that, in the successor's opinion, might have a material effect on, or require disclosure in, the financial statements reported on by the predecessor auditor. Also, the predecessor auditor may wish to consider the matters described in paragraphs .10 through .12 of AS 1205, <SPAN class="ft11">Part of the Audit Performed by Other Independent Auditors</SPAN>. However, the predecessor auditor should not refer in his or her reissued report to the report or work of the successor auditor.</P>
<P class="p138 ft5">.56 A predecessor auditor who has agreed to reissue his or her report may become aware of events or transactions occurring subsequent to the date of his or her previous report on the financial statements of a prior period that may affect his or her previous report (for example, the successor auditor might indicate in the response that certain matters have had a material effect on the <NOBR>prior-period</NOBR> financial statements reported on by the predecessor auditor). In such circumstances, the predecessor auditor should make inquiries and perform other procedures that he or she considers necessary (for example, reviewing the working papers of the successor auditor as they relate to the matters affecting the <NOBR>prior-period</NOBR> financial statements). The auditor should then decide, on the basis of the evidential matter obtained, whether to revise the report. If a predecessor auditor concludes that the report should be revised, he or she should follow the guidance in paragraphs .52, .53, and .57 of this section.</P>
<P class="p24 ft5">.57 A predecessor auditor's knowledge of the current affairs of his former client is obviously limited in the absence of a continuing relationship. Consequently, when reissuing the report on <NOBR>prior-period</NOBR> financial statements, a predecessor auditor should use the date of his or her previous report to avoid any implication that he or she has examined any records, transactions, or events after that date.
