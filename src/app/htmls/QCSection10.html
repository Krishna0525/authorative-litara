<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>
</p><p id="aucqc1001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01 </b>This section addresses a CPA firm's responsibilities for its system of quality control for its accounting and auditing practice. This section is to be read in conjunction with the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct and other relevant ethical requirements.
</p><p id="aucqc1002">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02 </b>This section, although applicable to audit and attestation engagements performed by CPA firms in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, does not apply to government audit organizations. Instead, those government audit organizations are subject to the quality control and assurance requirements of <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Government Auditing Standards</i>, which are similar to those of this section.
</p><p id="aucqc1003">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03 </b>Other professional standards set out additional requirements and guidance on the responsibilities of firm personnel regarding quality control procedures for specific types of engagements. AU-C section 220, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quality Control for an Engagement Conducted in Accordance With Generally Accepted Auditing Standards</i>, for example, addresses quality control procedures for engagements conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. [Revised, October 2011, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SAS No. 122.]
</p><p id="aucqc1004">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04 </b>A system of quality control consists of policies designed to achieve the objective set out in paragraph .12 and the procedures necessary to implement and monitor compliance with those policies.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requirements</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applying and Complying With Relevant Requirements</b>
</p><p id="aucqc1014">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.14 </b>Personnel within the firm responsible for establishing and maintaining the firm's system of quality control should have an understanding of the entire text of this section, including its application and other explanatory material, to understand its objective and apply its requirements properly.
</p><p id="aucqc1015">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.15 </b>The firm should comply with each requirement of this section unless, in the circumstances of the firm, the requirement is not relevant to the services provided by a firm's accounting and auditing practice. (Ref: par. .A1)
</p><p id="aucqc1016">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16 </b>The requirements are designed to enable the firm to achieve the objective stated in this section. The proper application of the requirements is, therefore, expected to provide a sufficient basis for the achievement of the objective. However, because circumstances vary widely and all such circumstances cannot be anticipated, the firm should consider whether there are particular matters or circumstances that require the firm to establish policies and procedures in addition to those required by this section to meet the stated objective.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elements of a System of Quality Control</b>
</p><p id="aucqc1017">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.17 </b>The firm must establish and maintain a system of quality control. The system of quality control should include policies and procedures addressing each of the following elements:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Leadership responsibilities for quality within the firm (the tone at the top)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. Relevant ethical requirements
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. Acceptance and continuance of client relationships and specific engagements
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. Human resources
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e. Engagement performance
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f. Monitoring
</p>
</p><p>Policies and procedures established by the firm related to each element are designed to achieve reasonable assurance with respect to the purpose of that element. Deficiencies in policies and procedures for an element may result in not achieving reasonable assurance with respect to the purpose of that element; however, the system of quality control as a whole may still be effective in achieving the objective described in paragraph .12.
</p><p id="aucqc1018">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.18 </b>The firm should document its policies and procedures and communicate them to the firm's personnel. (Ref: par. .A2–.A3)
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leadership Responsibilities for Quality Within the Firm</b>
</p><p id="aucqc1019">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.19 </b>The firm should establish policies and procedures designed to promote an internal culture based on the recognition that quality is essential in performing engagements. Such policies and procedures should require the firm's leadership (managing partner or board of managing partners, CEO, or equivalent) to assume ultimate responsibility for the firm's system of quality control. (Ref: par. .A4–.A5)
</p><p id="aucqc1020">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.20 </b>The firm should establish policies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable assurance that any person or persons assigned operational responsibility for the firm's system of quality control by the firm's leadership has sufficient and appropriate experience and ability, and the necessary authority, to assume that responsibility. (Ref: par. .A6)
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevant Ethical Requirements</b>
</p><p id="aucqc1021">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.21 </b>The firm should establish policies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable assurance that the firm and its personnel comply with relevant ethical requirements. (Ref: par. .A7–.A9)
