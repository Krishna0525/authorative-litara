<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement on Standards for
Tax Services No. 1, Tax Return
Positions</b>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. </b>This statement sets forth the applicable standards for members
when recommending tax return positions, or preparing or signing
tax returns (including amended returns, claims for refund, and information
returns) filed with any taxing authority. For purposes of these
standards
<ol type="a">
	<li><i>a tax return position is (i) </i>a position reflected on a tax return
on which a member has specifically advised a taxpayer or (ii) a
position about which a member has knowledge of all material
facts and, on the basis of those facts, has concluded whether
the position is appropriate.</li>
<li>a <i>taxpayer</i> is a client, a members employer, or any other
third-party recipient of tax services.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. </b>This statement also addresses a members obligation to advise
a taxpayer of relevant tax return disclosure responsibilities and potential
penalties.
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. </b>In addition to the AICPA, various taxing authorities, at the
federal, state, and local levels, may impose specific reporting and disclosure
standards with regard to recommending tax return positions
or preparing or signing tax returns.
1
 These standards can vary between
taxing authorities and by type of tax.
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement</b>
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. </b>A member should determine and comply with the standards,
if any, that are imposed by the applicable taxing authority with respect
to recommending a tax return position, or preparing or signing a tax
return.
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. </b>If the applicable taxing authority has no written standards with
respect to recommending a tax return position or preparing or signing
a tax return, or if its standards are lower than the standards set forth in
this paragraph, the following standards will apply:
<ol type="a">
	<li>A member should not recommend a tax return position or
prepare or sign a tax return taking a position unless the member
has a good-faith belief that the position has at least a realistic
possibility of being sustained administratively or judicially
on its merits if challenged.</li>
	<li>Notwithstanding paragraph 5(a), a member may recommend
a tax return position if the member (i) concludes that there
is a reasonable basis for the position and (ii) advises the taxpayer
to appropriately disclose that position. Notwithstanding
paragraph 5(a), a member may prepare or sign a tax return
that reflects a position if (i) the member concludes there is
a reasonable basis for the position and (ii) the position is appropriately
disclosed.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. </b>When recommending a tax return position or when preparing
or signing a tax return on which a position is taken, a member should,
when relevant, advise the taxpayer regarding potential penalty consequences
of such tax return position and the opportunity, if any, to
avoid such penalties through disclosure
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7. </b>A member should not recommend a tax return position or prepare
or sign a tax return reflecting a position that the member knows
<ol type="a">
	<li>. exploits the audit selection process of a taxing authority, or</li>
	<li>serves as a mere arguing position advanced solely to obtain
leverage in a negotiation with a taxing authority.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">8. </b>When recommending a tax return position, a member has
both the right and the responsibility to be an advocate for the taxpayer
with respect to any position satisfying the aforementioned standards.
</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Explanation </b></p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">9. </b>The AICPA and various taxing authorities impose specific
reporting and disclosure standards with respect to tax return positions
and preparing or signing tax returns. In a given situation, the standards,
if any, imposed by the applicable taxing authority may be higher or
lower than the standards set forth in paragraph 5. A member is to comply
with the standards, if any, of the applicable taxing authority; if the
applicable taxing authority has no standards or if its standards are lower
than the standards set forth in paragraph 5, the standards set forth in
paragraph 5 will apply.
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10. </b>Our self-assessment tax system can function effectively only
if taxpayers file tax returns that are true, correct, and complete. A
tax return is prepared based on a taxpayers representation of facts,
and the taxpayer has the final responsibility for positions taken on the
return. The standards that apply to a taxpayer may differ from those
that apply to a member
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">11. </b>In addition to a duty to the taxpayer, a member has a duty to
the tax system. However, it is well established that the taxpayer has no
obligation to pay more taxes than are legally owed, and a member has
a duty to the taxpayer to assist in achieving that result. The standards
contained in paragraphs 4-8 recognize a members responsibilities to
both the taxpayer and the tax system
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">12. </b>In reaching a conclusion concerning whether a given standard
in paragraph 4 or 5 has been satisfied, a member may consider a wellreasoned
construction of the applicable statute, well-reasoned articles
or treatises, or pronouncements issued by the applicable taxing authority,
regardless of whether such sources would be treated as authority
under Internal Revenue Code Section 6662, Imposition of accuracyrelated
penalty on underpayments, and the regulations thereunder. A
position would not fail to meet these standards merely because it is
later abandoned for practical or procedural considerations during an
administrative hearing or in the litigation process.
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">13. </b>If a member has a good-faith belief that more than one tax
return position meets the standards set forth in paragraphs 4-5, a
members advice concerning alternative acceptable positions may
include a discussion of the likelihood that each such position might or
might not cause the taxpayers tax return to be examined and whether the position would be challenged in an examination. In such circumstances,
such advice is not a violation of paragraph 7.
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">14. </b>A members determination of whether information is appropriately
disclosed by the taxpayer should be based on the facts and
circumstances of the particular case and the disclosure requirements
of the applicable taxing authority. If a member recommending a position,
but not engaged to prepare or sign the related tax return, advises
the taxpayer concerning appropriate disclosure of the position, then
the member shall be deemed to meet the disclosure requirements of
these standards.
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15. </b>	 If particular facts and circumstances lead a member to believe
that a taxpayer penalty might be asserted, the member should so
advise the taxpayer and should discuss with the taxpayer the opportunity,
if any, to avoid such penalty by disclosing the position on the tax
return. Although a member should advise the taxpayer with respect
to disclosure, it is the taxpayers responsibility to decide whether and
how to disclose.
</p>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">16. </b>For purposes of this statement, preparation of a tax return
includes giving advice on events that have occurred at the time the
advice is given if the advice is directly relevant to determining the
existence, character, or amount of a schedule, entry, or other portion
of a tax return.
