<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>.02 Because a compilation engagement is not an assurance engagement, a compilation engagement does not require the accountant to verify the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by management or otherwise gather evidence to express an opinion or a conclusion on the financial statements.<br>Effective Date</p>
