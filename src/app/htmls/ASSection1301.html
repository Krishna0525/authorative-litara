      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>AS 1301: Communications with Audit Committees</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.01</b> This standard requires the auditor to communicate with the company's <b>audit committee</b><sup>1</sup> regarding certain matters related to the conduct of an audit<sup>2</sup> and to obtain certain information from the audit committee relevant to the audit. This standard also requires the auditor to establish an understanding of the terms of the audit engagement with the audit committee and to record that understanding in an engagement letter.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.02</b> Other Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“ PCAOB”) rules and standards identify additional matters to be communicated to a company's audit committee (<em>see</em> Appendix B). Various laws or regulations also require the auditor to communicate certain matters to the audit committee.<sup>3</sup> The communication requirements of this standard do not modify or replace communications to the audit committee required by such other PCAOB rules and standards, and other laws or regulations. Nothing in this standard precludes the auditor from communicating other matters to the audit committee.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Objectives</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.03</b> The objectives of the auditor are to:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. Communicate to the audit committee the responsibilities of the auditor in relation to the audit and establish an understanding of the terms of the audit engagement with the audit committee;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. Obtain information from the audit committee relevant to the audit;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. Communicate to the audit committee an overview of the overall audit strategy and timing of the audit; and</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. Provide the audit committee with timely observations arising from the audit that are significant to the financial reporting process.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> “Communicate to,” as used in this standard, is meant to encourage effective two-way communication between the auditor and the audit committee throughout the audit to assist in understanding matters relevant to the audit.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Appointment and Retention</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Significant Issues Discussed with Management in Connection with the Auditor's Appointment or Retention</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.04</b> The auditor should discuss with the audit committee any significant issues that the auditor discussed with management in connection with the appointment or retention of the auditor, including significant discussions regarding the application of accounting principles and auditing standards.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Establish an Understanding of the Terms of the Audit</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.05</b> The auditor should establish an understanding of the terms of the audit engagement with the audit committee. This understanding includes communicating to the audit committee the following:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. The objective of the audit;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. The responsibilities of the auditor; and</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. The responsibilities of management.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.06</b> The auditor should record the understanding of the terms of the audit engagement in an engagement letter and provide the engagement letter to the audit committee annually. The auditor should have the engagement letter executed by the appropriate party or parties on behalf of the company.<sup>4</sup> If the appropriate party or parties are other than the audit committee, or its chair on behalf of the audit committee, the auditor should determine that the audit committee has acknowledged and agreed to the terms of the engagement.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> Appendix C describes matters that the auditor should include in the engagement letter about the terms of the audit engagement.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.07</b> If the auditor cannot establish an understanding of the terms of the audit engagement with the audit committee, the auditor should decline to accept, continue, or perform the engagement.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Obtaining Information and Communicating the Audit Strategy</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Obtaining Information Relevant to the Audit</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.08</b> The auditor should inquire of the audit committee about whether it is aware of matters relevant to the audit,<sup>5</sup> including, but not limited to, violations or possible violations of laws or regulations.<sup>6</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Overall Audit Strategy, Timing of the Audit, and Significant Risks</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.09</b> The auditor should communicate to the audit committee an overview of the overall audit strategy, including the timing of the audit,<sup>7</sup> and discuss with the audit committee the significant risks identified during the auditor's risk assessment procedures.<sup>8</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> This overview is intended to provide information about the audit, but not specific details that would compromise the effectiveness of the audit procedures.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.10</b> As part of communicating the overall audit strategy, the auditor should communicate the following matters to the audit committee, if applicable:

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. The extent to which the auditor plans to use the work of internal auditors, company personnel (in addition to internal auditors), and third parties working under the direction of management or the audit committee when performing an audit of internal control over financial reporting;<sup>11</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. The names, locations, and planned responsibilities<sup>12</sup> of other independent public accounting firms or other persons, who are not employed by the auditor, that perform audit procedures in the current period audit; and
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> The term “other independent public accounting firms” in the context of this communication includes firms that perform audit procedures in the current period audit regardless of whether they otherwise have any relationship with the auditor.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">e. The basis for the auditor's determination that the auditor can serve as principal auditor, if significant parts of the audit are to be performed by other auditors.<sup>13</sup></p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. Note: Critical accounting policies and practices, as defined in Appendix A, are a company's accounting policies and practices that are both most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results, and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical accounting policies and practices are tailored to specific events in the current year, and the accounting policies and practices that are considered critical might change from year to year.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. <b>Critical accounting estimates</b>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> As part of its communications to the audit committee, management might communicate some or all of the matters in paragraph .12. If management communicates any of these matters, the auditor does not need to communicate them at the same level of detail as management, as long as the auditor (1) participated in management's discussion with the audit committee, (2) affirmatively confirmed to the audit committee that management has adequately communicated these matters, and (3) with respect to critical accounting policies and practices, identified for the audit committee those accounting policies and practices that the auditor considers critical. The auditor should communicate any omitted or inadequately described matters to the audit committee.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(2) The results of the auditor's evaluation of the differences between (i) estimates best supported by the audit evidence and (ii) estimates included in the financial statements, which are individually reasonable, that indicate a possible bias on the part of the company's management.<sup>22</sup></p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.16</b> When the auditor is aware that management consulted with other accountants about significant auditing or accounting matters and the auditor has identified a concern regarding such matters, the auditor should communicate to the audit committee his or her views about such matters that were the subject of such consultation.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Going Concern</b></p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(1) The effects, if any, on the financial statements and the adequacy of the related disclosure;<sup>32</sup> and
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(2) The effects on the auditor's report.<sup>33</sup></p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">.C1 The auditor should include the following matters in the engagement letter.<sup>1</sup> The auditor's description of these matters will vary depending on whether the auditor is engaged in a financial statement audit or in an audit of internal control over financial reporting that is integrated with an audit of financial statements (“ integrated audit”).
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. The objective of the audit is:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">1. Integrated audit: The expression of an opinion on both the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the financial statements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. Audit of financial statements: The expression of an opinion on the financial statements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. Auditor's responsibilities:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">1. The auditor is responsible for conducting the audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Those standards require that the auditor:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. Integrated audit: Plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Accordingly, there is some risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting would remain undetected. Although not absolute assurance, reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance. Also, an integrated audit is not designed to detect error or fraud that is immaterial to the financial statements or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that, individually or in combination, are less severe than a material weakness. If, for any reason, the auditor is unable to complete the audit or is unable to form or has not formed an opinion, he or she may decline to express an opinion or decline to issue a report as a result of the engagement.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. Audit of financial statements: Plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud. Accordingly, there is some risk that a material misstatement would remain undetected. Although not absolute assurance, reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance. Also, a financial statement audit is not designed to detect error or fraud that is immaterial to the financial statements. If, for any reason, the auditor is unable to complete the audit or is unable to form or has not formed an opinion, he or she may decline to express an opinion or decline to issue a report as a result of the engagement.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. An audit includes:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. Integrated audit: In fulfillment of the responsibilities noted above, the auditor communicates:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">1. To the audit committee and management: all material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified during the audit, in writing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. To the audit committee: all significant deficiencies identified during the audit, in writing, and informs the audit committee when the auditor has informed management of all internal control deficiencies.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">3. To management: all internal control deficiencies identified during the audit and not previously communicated in writing by the auditor or by others, including internal auditors or others within the company.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">4. To the board of directors: any conclusion that the audit committee's oversight of the company's external financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting is ineffective, in writing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. Audit of financial statements: Obtaining an understanding of internal control sufficient to plan the audit and to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures to be performed.<sup>2</sup> An audit of financial statements is not designed to provide assurance on internal control or to identify internal control deficiencies. However, the auditor is responsible for communicating:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">1. To the audit committee and management: all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses identified during the audit, in writing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. To the board of directors: if the auditor becomes aware that the oversight of the company's external financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting by the audit committee is ineffective, that conclusion, in writing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. Management's responsibilities:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">1. Management is responsible for the company's financial statements, including disclosures.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">3. Management is responsible for identifying and ensuring that the company complies with the laws and regulations applicable to its activities.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">4. Management is responsible for making all financial records and relevant information available to the auditor.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">5. At the conclusion of the engagement, management will provide the auditor with a letter that confirms certain representations made during the audit.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">6. Management is responsible for adjusting the financial statements to correct material misstatements relating to accounts or disclosures and for affirming to the auditor in the representation letter that the effects of any uncorrected misstatements aggregated by the auditor are immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">.C2 In connection with a review of interim financial information, to confirm and document the understanding, the auditor should either: (a) document in the audit engagement letter the nature and objectives of the engagement to review interim financial information and the responsibilities of management and the auditor or (b) issue a separate engagement letter that addresses such matters.<sup>3</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Footnotes (AS 1301 - Communications with Audit Committees):</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">1. Terms defined in Appendix A, <em>Definitions</em>, are set in <b>boldface type</b> the first time they appear.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. For purposes of this standard, an audit is either an audit of internal control over financial reporting that is integrated with an audit of financial statements or an audit of financial statements only.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">3. <em>See e.g</em>., Section 10A(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“ Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78j-1(k); Rule 2-07 of Regulation S-X, 17 C.F.R. § 210.2-07; and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10A-3.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">4. Absent evidence to the contrary, the auditor may rely on the company's identification of the appropriate party or parties to execute the engagement letter.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">5. In addition to this inquiry, paragraphs .05f and .54-.57 of AS 2110, <em>Identifying and Assessing Risks of Material Misstatement</em>, describe the auditor's inquiries of the audit committee, or equivalent (or its chair) regarding the audit committee's knowledge of the risks of material misstatement, including fraud risks. These inquiries include, among other things, whether the audit committee is aware of tips or complaints regarding the company's financial reporting.

      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">8. AS 2110 requires the auditor to determine whether identified and assessed risks are significant risks. A significant risk is defined as a risk of material misstatement that requires special audit consideration.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">9. <em>See</em> AS 2101.16 for the requirement for the auditor to determine whether specialized skill or knowledge is needed to perform appropriate risk assessments, plan or perform audit procedures, or evaluate audit results.
