<p class="header">&gt;   Research and Development Costs of Computer Software</p>
</p><p id="98525">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-1</b>  All costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are research and development costs. Those costs shall be charged to expense when incurred as required by Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">730-10</u>.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-2</b>  For purposes of this Subtopic, the technological feasibility of a computer software product is established when the entity has completed all planning, designing, <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">coding</b>, and <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">testing</b> activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. At a minimum, the entity shall have performed the activities in either (a) or (b) as evidence that technological feasibility has been established:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. If the process of creating the computer software product includes a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">detail program design</b>, all of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1. The <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">product design</b> and the detail program design have been completed, and the entity has established that the necessary skills, hardware, and software technology are available to the entity to produce the product.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2. The completeness of the detail program design and its consistency with the product design have been confirmed by documenting and tracing the detail program design to product specifications.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">3. The detail program design has been reviewed for high-risk development issues (for example, novel, unique, unproven functions and features or technological innovations), and any uncertainties related to identified high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. If the process of creating the computer software product does not include a detail program design with the features identified in (a), both of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1. A product design and a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">working model</b> of the software product have been completed.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2. The completeness of the working model and its consistency with the product design have been confirmed by testing.
</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Production Costs of Computer Software</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-3</b>  Costs of producing product masters incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility shall be capitalized. Those costs include coding and testing performed subsequent to establishing technological feasibility.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-4</b>  Software production costs for computer software that is to be used as an integral part of a product or process shall not be capitalized until both of the following conditions have been met:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Technological feasibility has been established for the software.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. All research and development activities for the other components of the product or process have been completed.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-5</b>  An entity may capitalize an allocated amount of indirect costs, such as overhead related to programmers and the facilities they occupy. However, an allocation of general and administrative expenses is not appropriate because those costs relate to the period in which they are incurred.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-6</b>  Capitalization of computer software costs shall cease when the product is available for general release to customers. Costs of <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">maintenance</b> and <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">customer support</b> shall be charged to expense when related revenue is recognized or when those costs are incurred, whichever occurs first.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Purchased Computer Software</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-7</b>  Some entities purchase software as an alternative to developing it internally. Purchased computer software may be modified or integrated with another product process.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-8</b>  The cost of purchased computer software to be sold,leased, or otherwise marketed that has no alternative future use shall be accounted for the same as the costs incurred to develop such software internally, as specified in paragraphs 985-20-25-1 through 25-6.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-9</b>  An entity shall capitalize the total cost of purchased software if the criteria specified in paragraph 985-20-25-2 are met at the time of purchase.  Otherwise, the cost will be charged to expense as research and development.  For example, if the technological feasibility of a software product as a whole (that is, the product that will be ultimately marketed) has been established at the time software is purchased, the cost of the purchased software shall be capitalized and further accounted for in accordance with the other provisions of the Subtopic.  The cost of software purchased to be integrated with another product or process shall be capitalized only if technological feasibility is established for the software component and if all research and development activities for the other components of the product or process are completed at the time of purchase.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-10</b>  If purchased software has an alternative future use, the cost shall be capitalized when the software is acquired and accounted for in accordance with its use.  The alternative future use test also applies to purchased software that will be integrated with a product or process in which the research and development activities for the other components are not complete.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Inventory Costs</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-11</b>  For guidance on costs incurred for duplicating the computer software, documentation, and training materials from product masters and for physically packaging the product for distribution, see Subtopic 985-330.
