</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Recognition Section   provides guidance on the required criteria, timing, and location (within the financial statements) for recording a particular item in the financial statements.  Disclosure is not recognition.
</p><p>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Goodwill Recognition</b>
</p><p id="80525">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-1</b>  The acquirer shall recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date, measured as described in paragraph 805-30-30-1.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Gain from Bargain Purchase</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-2</b>  Occasionally, an acquirer will make a bargian purchase, which is a business combination in which the amount in paragraph 805-30-30-1(b) exceeds the aggregate of the amounts specified in (a) in that paragraph.  If that excess remains after applying the requirements in paragraph 805-30-25-4, the acquirer shall recognize the resulting gain in earnings on the acquisition date.  The gain shall be attributed to the acquirer.  Example 1 (see paragraph 805-30-55-14) provides an illustration of this guidance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-3</b>  A bargain purchase might happen, for example, in a business combination that is a forced sale n which the seller is acting under compulsion.  However, the recognition or measurement exceptions for particular items identified in paragraphs 805-20-25-16, and 805-20-30-10 also may r4sult in recognizing a gain (or change in the amount of a recognized gain) on a bargain purchase.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-4</b>  Before recognizing a gain on a bargain purchase, the acquirer shall reassess whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and shall recognize any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review.  See paragraphs 805-30-30-4 through 30-6 for guidance on the review of measurements procedures in connection with a reassessment required by this paragraph.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Contingent Consideration</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-5</b>  The consideration the acquirer transfers in exchange for the acquiree includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.  the acquirer shall recognize the acquisition-date fair value of contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-6</b>  The acquirer shall classify an obligation to pay contingent consideration as a liability or as equity in accordance with Subtopic 480-10 and 815-40 or other applicable generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For example, Subtopic 480-10 provides guidance on whether to classify as a liability a contingent consideration arrangement that is, in substance, a put option written by the acquirer on the market price of the acquirer's shares issued in the business combination.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-7</b>  The acquirer shall classify as an asset a right ot the return of previously transferred consideration if specified conditions are met.
