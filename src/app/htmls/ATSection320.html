<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .01 </b> This section contains performance and reporting requirements and ap-
plication guidance for a service auditor examining controls at organizations
that provide services to user entities when those controls are likely to be rele-
vant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting. It complements
AU-C section 402,
Audit Considerations Relating to an Entity Using a Service
Organization
, in that a service auditor's report prepared in accordance with
this section may provide appropriate evidence under AU-C section 402. (Ref:
par. .A1)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .02 </b> In addition to complying with this section, a practitioner is required
to comply with section 105,
Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements
,
and section 205,
Examination Engagements
. In some cases, this section repeats
or refers to requirements in sections 105 and 205 when describing those re-
quirements in the context of examinations that address controls at a service
organization likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over finan-
cial reporting. Although not all the requirements in sections 105 and 205 are
repeated or referred to in this section, the practitioner is responsible for com-
plying with all the requirements in sections 105 and 205. (Ref: par. .A2)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .03 </b> Section 205 indicates that when performing an attestation engage-
ment, a practitioner should report on a written assertion or should report di-
rectly on the subject matter.

For engagements conducted under this section,
the service auditor reports directly on the subject matter.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .04 </b> The focus of this section is on controls at service organizations likely to
be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting. The guid-
ance herein also may be helpful to a practitioner performing an engagement
under section 205 to report on controls at a service organization
<ol type="a">
	<li>other than those that are likely to be relevant to user entities'
internal control over financial reporting (for example, controls
that affect user entities' compliance with specified requirements
of laws, regulations, rules, contracts, or grants or controls that
affect user entities' production or quality control). Section 315, Compliance Attestation
, is applicable if a practitioner is perform-
ing agreed-upon procedures related to an entity's internal control
over compliance with specified requirements. Section 205 is ap-
plicable if a practitioner is examining an entity's controls over
compliance with specified requirements. (Ref: par. .A3–.A4)</li>
	<li>when management of the service organization does not provide an
assertion about the suitability of the design of controls because it
is not responsible for the design of the controls (for example, when
the controls have been designed by the user entity or the design
is stipulated in a contract between the user entity and the service
organization). (Ref: par. .A5)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .05 </b> In addition to performing an examination of a service organization's
controls, a service auditor may be engaged to (
a
) examine and report on a user
entity's transactions or balances maintained by a service organization, or (
b
)
perform and report under section 215,
Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements
,
the results of agreed-upon procedures related to the controls of a service orga-
nization or to transactions or balances of a user entity maintained by a service
organization. However, these engagements are not addressed in this section.</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>The service auditor's preliminary knowledge of the engagement
circumstances indicates that the scope of the engagement and
management's description of the service organization's system
will not be so limited that they are unlikely to be useful to user
entities and their auditors.</li>
	<li>Management acknowledges and accepts its responsibility for the
following:</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li>Preparing its description of the service organization's sys-
tem and its assertion, including the completeness, accu-
racy, and method of presentation of the description and
assertion (Ref: par. .A14)</li>

		<li>Selecting the criteria to be used and stating them in the
assertion</li>
		<li>Specifying the control objectives, stating them in the de-
scription of the service organization's system, and, if the
control objectives are specified by law, regulation, or an-
other party (for example, a user group or a professional
body), identifying in the description the party specifying
the control objectives (Ref: par. .A16)</li>
		<li>Identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of the
control objectives stated in the description and designing,
implementing, and documenting controls that are suitably
designed and operating effectively to provide reasonable
assurance that the control objectives stated in the descrip-
tion of the service organization's system will be achieved
(Ref: par. .A17)</li>

of the service organization's system includes relevant details of
changes to the service organization's system during the period
covered by the description. (Ref: par. .A50)</li>
	<li>whether management's description of the service organization's
system does not omit or distort information relevant to the service
organization's system, while acknowledging that management's
description of the service organization's system is prepared to
meet the common needs of a broad range of user entities and their
user auditors, and may not, therefore, include every aspect of the
service organization's system that each individual user entity and its user auditor may consider important in its own particular en-

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .29 </b> When performing a type 2 engagement, the service auditor should ob-
tain an understanding of changes in the service organization's system that were
implemented during the period covered by the service auditor's report. If the
service auditor believes the changes would be considered significant by user en-
tities and their auditors, the service auditor should determine whether those
changes are included in management's description of the service organization's
system. If such changes are not included in the description, the service audi-
tor should describe the changes in the report and determine the effect on the
report. If superseded controls are relevant to the achievement of the control ob-
jectives stated in the description, the service auditor should, if possible, test the
superseded controls before the change. If the service auditor cannot test super-
seded controls relevant to the achievement of the control objectives stated in
the description, the service auditor should determine the effect on the report.

The refusal by management
of the service organization (or by management of a subservice organization that
is being presented using the inclusive method) to furnish the written represen-

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A1 </b>Controls related to a service organization's operations and compliance
objectives may be relevant to a user entity's internal control over financial re-
porting. Such controls may pertain to assertions about presentation and dis-
closure relating to account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures, or
may pertain to evidence that the user auditor evaluates or uses in applying
auditing procedures. For example, a payroll processing service organization's
controls related to the timely remittance of payroll deductions to government
authorities may be relevant to a user entity because late remittances could in-
cur interest and penalties that would result in a liability to the user entity.
Similarly, a service organization's controls over the acceptability of investment
transactions from a regulatory perspective may be considered relevant to a user
entity's presentation and disclosure of transactions and account balances in its
financial statements.</p>

report on controls at a service organization other than those controls likely to
be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting, and the
service auditor intends to use the guidance in this section in planning and per-
forming that engagement, the service auditor may encounter matters that dif-
fer significantly from those associated with engagements to report on a service
organization's controls likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control
over financial reporting. The following are examples of such matters:
<ul>
	<li>Identification of suitable and available criteria, as prescribed in
section 105, for evaluating the fairness of presentation of man-
agement's description of the service organization's system and the suitability of the design and the operating effectiveness of the
controls
</li>
	<li>Identification of appropriate control objectives, and the basis for
evaluating the reasonableness of the control objectives in the cir-
cumstances of the particular engagement</li>
	<li>Identification of the intended users of the report and the manner
in which they intend to use the report</li>
	<li>Relevance and appropriateness of the definitions in paragraph
.08, many of which specifically relate to internal control over fi-
nancial reporting</li>
	<li>Application of references to auditing standards (AU-C sections)
that are intended to provide the service auditor with guidance rel-
evant to internal control over financial reporting</li>
	<li>Application of the concept of materiality in the circumstances of
the particular engagement</li>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A5 </b>In some circumstances, management of the service organization may
not be in a position to assert that the controls are suitably designed, for exam-
ple, because the controls have been designed by management of the user entity.
If management is unable to assert that the controls are suitably designed, man-
agement would also be precluded from asserting that the controls are operating
effectively because of the inextricable link between the suitability of the design
of controls and their operating effectiveness. The absence of an assertion with
respect to the suitability of design of controls would preclude the service au-
ditor from expressing an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls. As
an alternative, the practitioner may report under section 205 on whether the
controls were operating as described or may perform agreed-upon procedures
under section 215</p>

sign and operating effectiveness of controls in support of management's asser-
tion.
Monitoring of controls
is a process to assess the effectiveness of internal
control performance over time. It involves assessing the effectiveness of con-
trols on a timely basis, identifying and reporting deficiencies to appropriate
individuals within the service organization, and taking necessary corrective
actions. Management accomplishes monitoring of controls through ongoing ac-
tivities, separate evaluations, or a combination of the two. Ongoing monitoring
activities are often built into the normal recurring activities of an entity and
include regular management and supervisory activities. Internal auditors or
personnel performing similar functions may contribute to the monitoring of a
service organization's activities. Monitoring activities may also include using
information communicated by external parties, such as customer complaints,
which may indicate problems or highlight areas in need of improvement. The
greater the degree and effectiveness of ongoing monitoring, the less need for
separate evaluations. Usually, some combination of ongoing monitoring and
separate evaluations will ensure that internal control maintains its effective-
ness over time. The service auditor's report on controls is not a substitute for
the service organization's own processes to provide a reasonable basis for its
assertion.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Management’s Responsibility for Control Objectives (Ref. par. 10b[iv])</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A16 </b>The control objectives stated in management's description of the ser-
vice organization's system relate to the types of financial statement assertions
commonly embodied in the broad range of user entities' financial statements
to which controls at the service organization could reasonably be expected to
relate.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Management’s Responsibility for Identifying Risks (Ref: par. .10b[v])</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A17 </b>Control objectives relate to risks that controls seek to mitigate. For
example, the risk that a transaction is recorded at the wrong amount or in
the wrong period can be expressed as a control objective that transactions are
recorded at the correct amount and in the correct period. Management is re-
sponsible for identifying the risks that threaten achievement of the control ob-
jectives stated in management's description of the service organization's sys-
tem. A service organization's controls may be designed with the assumption
that user entities will have implemented complementary user entity controls
or that subservice organizations will have implemented complementary subser-
vice organization controls that are necessary to achieve the control objectives.
The risks that management identifies also include the risk that such controls
were not implemented by user entities or subservice organizations or that those
controls were not operating effectively. Management may have a formal or in-
formal process for identifying relevant risks. A formal process may include es-
timating the significance of identified risks, assessing the likelihood of their oc-
currence, and deciding about actions to address them. However, because control objectives relate to risks that controls seek to mitigate, thoughtful identifica-
tion by management of control objectives when designing, implementing, and
documenting the service organization's system may itself comprise an informal
process for identifying relevant risks</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Providing a Written Assertion (Ref: par. .10b[vi])</i></b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A18 </b>The service organization's assertion may be attached to the descrip-
tion of the service organization's system or may be included in the description
if clearly segregated from the description, for example, through the use of head-
ings. Segregating the assertion from the description clarifies that the assertion
is not part of the description. (See subparagraph (b) of the definitions of
man-
agement's description of a service organization's system and a service auditor's
report on that description and on the suitability of the design of controls
and

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A19 </b>The inclusive method is generally feasible if, for example, the service
organization and the subservice organization are related, or if the contract be-
tween the service organization and the subservice organization provides for the
use of the inclusive method. In such circumstances, the service organization is
the engaging party, and the requirements relative to agreeing on the terms of
the engagement may not be applicable.</p>

	<li>acknowledgment from management of the subservice organiza-

reasonable justification if, for example, the request is made

those control objectives.</li>
	<li>to prevent the disclosure of deviations identified at a subservice

the carve-out method.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A22 </b>A request to change the scope of the engagement may have a reason-
able justification when, for example, the request is made because the service
organization, a transfer agent, after providing the description of its system to
the service auditor, decides that it would like to remove a control objective re-
lated to new fund setup because only one fund was set up during the reporting
period, and management of the fund had performed its own testing. The ser-
vice auditor concluded that the removal of the control objective related to new
fund setup was reasonable in the circumstances because the objective was not
relevant to a broad range of user entities during the examination period.</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A28 </b>In an engagement to report on controls at a service organization, the
concept of materiality relates to the information being reported on, not the fi-
nancial statements of user entities. The service auditor plans and performs
procedures to determine whether, in all material respects, based on the criteria
in management's assertion, management's description of the service organiza-
tion's system is fairly presented; controls at the service organization are suit-
ably designed to achieve the control objectives stated in the description; and, in
the case of a type 2 report, controls at the service organization operated effec-
tively throughout the specified period to achieve the control objectives stated in
the description. The concept of materiality takes into account that the service
auditor's report provides information about the service organization's system
to meet the common information needs of a broad range of user entities and
their auditors who have an understanding of the manner in which the system
is being used by a particular user entity for financial reporting.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A29 </b>Materiality with respect to the fair presentation of management's
description of the service organization's system and with respect to the design of

	<li>management's description of the service organization's system in-
cludes the significant aspects of the processing of transactions.</li>
	<li>management's description of the service organization's system
omits or distorts relevant information.</li>
	<li>the controls have the ability, as designed, to provide reasonable
assurance that the control objectives stated in management's de-
scription of the service organization's system would be achieved.</li>
<p>Materiality with respect to the operating effectiveness of controls includes the
consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors, for example, the tol-
erable rate and observed rate of deviation (a quantitative matter) and the na-
ture and cause of any observed deviations (a qualitative matter).</p>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A30 </b>The concept of materiality is not applied when disclosing, in the de-
scription of the tests of controls, the results of those tests when deviations have
been identified. This is because in the particular circumstances of a specific
user entity or user auditor, a deviation may have significance beyond whether
or not, in the opinion of the service auditor, it prevents a control from operat-
ing effectively. For example, the control to which the deviation relates may be particularly significant in preventing a certain type of error that may be mate-
rial in the particular circumstances of a user entity's financial statements.</p>

plans and performs the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance of detect-

assurance is not attainable because of factors such as the need for judgment,
the use of sampling, and the inherent limitations of controls at the service orga-
nization that affect whether the description is fairly presented and the controls
are suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve the control objectives,
and because much of the evidence available to the service auditor is persuasive,
rather than conclusive, in nature. Also, procedures that are effective for de-
tecting unintentional misstatements in the description, and instances in which
control objectives were not achieved, may be ineffective for detecting misstate-
ments in the description resulting from fraud and instances in which the con-
trol objectives were not achieved that are concealed through collusion between
service organization personnel and a third party or among management or em-
ployees of the service organization. Therefore, the subsequent discovery of the
existence of material misstatements in the description or instances in which

a
[vi] and .25–.26)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A37</b> Considering the following questions may assist the service auditor
in determining whether management's description of the service organization's
system is fairly presented, in all material respects, based on the criteria in man-
agement's assertion:
<ul>
	<li>Is the description prepared at a level of detail that could reason-
ably be expected to provide a broad range of user auditors with
sufficient information to obtain an understanding of internal con-
trol in accordance with AU-C section 402? The description need
not address every aspect of the service organization's processing
or the services provided to user entities and need not be so detailed that it would potentially enable a reader to compromise security
or other controls at the service organization.</li>
	<li>Is the description prepared in a manner that does not omit or dis-
tort information that might affect the decisions of a broad range
of user auditors, for example, does the description contain any sig-
nificant omissions or inaccuracies regarding processing of which
the service auditor is aware?</li>
	<li>Does the description include relevant details of changes to the ser-
vice organization's system during the period covered by the de-
scription when the description covers a period of time?</li>
	<li>Have the controls identified in the description actually been im-
plemented?</li>
	<li>If the inclusive method has been used, does the description sepa-
rately identify controls at the service organization and controls at
the subservice organization? Does the description include activi-
ties at the service organization that monitor the effectiveness of
controls at the subservice organization?</li>
	<li>Are complementary user entity controls, if any, adequately de-
scribed? In most cases, the control objectives stated in the descrip-
tion are worded so that they are capable of being achieved through
the effective operation of controls implemented by the service or-
ganization alone. In some cases, however, the control objectives
stated in the description cannot be achieved by the service orga-
nization alone because their achievement requires particular con-
trols to be implemented by user entities. For example, to achieve
the specified control objectives, a user entity may need to review
the completeness and accuracy of input provided to the service or-
ganization before submitting it to the service organization or the
completeness and accuracy of reports provided to the user entity
subsequent to processing. When the description does include com-
plementary user entity controls, the description separately iden-
tifies those controls, along with the specific control objectives that
cannot be achieved by the service organization alone.</li>
	<li>If the carve-out method has been used, does the description iden-
tify the functions that are performed by the subservice organiza-
tion? (When the carve-out method has been used, the description
does not describe the detailed processing or controls at the subser-
vice organization.) Does the description include activities at the
service organization that monitor the effectiveness of controls at
the subservice organization as well as complementary subservice
organization controls?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A38 </b> The service auditor's procedures to evaluate the fair presentation of
management's description of the service organization's system may include the
following:
<ul>
	<li>Considering the nature of the user entities and how the services
provided by the service organization are likely to affect them, for
example, the predominant types of user entities, and whether the
user entities are regulated by government agencies</li>
	<li>Reading contracts with user entities to gain an understanding of
the service organization's contractual obligations</li>
	<li>Observing procedures performed by service organization per-
sonnel</li>
	<li>Reviewing the service organization's policy and procedure man-
uals and other documentation of the system, for example,
flowcharts and narratives</li>
	<li>Performing walkthroughs of transactions through the service or-
ganization's system</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A39 </b> Paragraph .25
a
requires the service auditor to evaluate whether the
control objectives stated in management's description of the service organiza-
tion's system are reasonable in the circumstances. Considering the following
questions may assist the service auditor in this evaluation:
<ul>
	<li>Do the control objectives stated in the description relate to the
types of assertions commonly embodied in the broad range of user
entities' financial statements to which controls at the service or-
ganization could reasonably be expected to relate (for example,
assertions about existence and accuracy that are affected by ac-
cess controls that prevent or detect unauthorized access to the
system)? Although the service auditor ordinarily will not be able
to determine how controls at a service organization specifically re-
late to the assertions embodied in individual user entities' finan-
cial statements, the service auditor considers matters, such as the
following, when identifying the types of assertions to which the
controls are likely to relate:</li>
<p>— The types of services provided by the service organization,
including the classes of transactions processed</p>
<p>— The contents of reports and other information prepared for
user entities</p>
<p>— The information used in the performance of procedures</p>
<p>— The types of significant events other than transactions
that occur in providing the services</p>
<p>— Services performed by a subservice organization, if any</p>
<p>— The responsibility of the service organization to imple-
ment controls, including responsibilities established in
contracts and agreements with user entities</p>
<p>— The risks to a user entity's internal control over financial
reporting arising from information technology used or pro-
vided by the service organization</p>
	<li>Are the control objectives stated in the description complete? Al-
though a complete set of control objectives can provide a broad
range of user auditors with a framework to assess the effect of
controls at the service organization on assertions commonly em-
bodied in user entities' financial statements, the service auditor
ordinarily will not be able to determine how controls at a ser-
vice organization specifically relate to the assertions embodied in
individual user entities' financial statements and cannot, there-
fore, determine whether control objectives are complete from the
viewpoint of individual user entities or user auditors. It is the re-
sponsibility of individual user entities or user auditors to assess
whether the service organization's description addresses the par-
ticular control objectives that are relevant to their needs. If the
control objectives are specified by an outside party, including con-
trol objectives specified by law or regulation, the outside party is
responsible for their completeness and reasonableness.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A40 </b> The service auditor's procedures to determine whether the system
described by the service organization has been implemented may be similar to,
and performed in conjunction with, procedures to obtain an understanding of
that system. Other procedures that the service auditor may use in combination
with inquiry of management and other service organization personnel include
observation, inspection of records and other documentation, and reperformance
of the manner in which transactions are processed through the system and
controls are applied.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obtaining Evidence Regarding the Design of Controls
(Ref: par. .27)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A41</b> The risks and control objectives identified in paragraph .27 encom-
pass fraud and unintentional acts that threaten the achievement of the control
objectives.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A42</b> From the viewpoint of a user auditor, a control is suitably designed
to achieve the control objectives stated in management's description of the ser-
vice organization's system if individually or in combination with other controls,
it would, when complied with satisfactorily, provide reasonable assurance that
material misstatements are prevented, or detected and corrected. A service au-
ditor, however, is not aware of the circumstances at individual user entities that
would affect whether or not a misstatement is material to those user entities.
Therefore, from the viewpoint of a service auditor, a control is suitably designed
if individually or in combination with other controls, it would, when complied
with satisfactorily, provide reasonable assurance that the control objective(s)
stated in the description of the service organization's system are achieved.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A43</b> A service auditor may consider using flowcharts, questionnaires, or
decision tables to facilitate understanding the design of the controls.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A44</b> Controls may consist of a number of activities directed at the achieve-
ment of various control objectives. Consequently, if the service auditor evalu-
ates certain activities as being ineffective in achieving a particular control ob-
jective, the existence of other activities may allow the service auditor to con-
clude that controls related to the control objective are suitably designed to
achieve the control objective. (Ref: par. .27)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A45</b> The service organization may have different controls in place to ad-
dress each of the risks associated with the control objective; therefore, multiple
controls may be needed in order for the service auditor to conclude on the design
of controls relating to each of the risks associated with the control objective</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obtaining Evidence Regarding the Operating Effectiveness of
Controls (Ref: par. .15
b
and .28–.29)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A46</b> From the viewpoint of a user auditor, a control is operating effectively
if individually or in combination with other controls, it provides reasonable as-
surance that material misstatements are prevented, or detected and corrected.
A service auditor, however, is not aware of the circumstances at individual user
entities that would affect whether or not a misstatement resulting from a con-
trol deviation is material to those user entities. Therefore, from the viewpoint
of a service auditor, a control is operating effectively if, individually or in com-
bination with other controls, it provides reasonable assurance that the control
objectives stated in management's description of the service organization's sys-
tem are achieved. Similarly, a service auditor is not in a position to determine whether any observed control deviation would result in a material misstate-
ment from the viewpoint of an individual user entity</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A47</b> Obtaining an understanding of controls sufficient to opine on the
suitability of their design is not sufficient evidence regarding their operating ef-
fectiveness unless some automation provides for the consistent operation of the
controls as they were designed and implemented. For example, obtaining infor-
mation about the implementation of a manual control at a point in time does
not provide evidence about operation of the control at other times. However,
because of the inherent consistency of IT processing, performing procedures to
determine the design of an automated application control and whether it has
been implemented may serve as evidence of that control's operating effective-
ness, depending on the service auditor's assessment and testing of IT general
controls such as those over program changes.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A48</b> Evidence about the satisfactory operation of controls in prior peri-
ods does not provide evidence of the operating effectiveness of controls during
the current period. The service auditor expresses an opinion on the effective-
ness of controls throughout each period; therefore, sufficient appropriate evi-
dence about the operating effectiveness of controls throughout the current pe-
riod is required for the service auditor to express that opinion for the current
period. Knowledge of modifications to the service auditor's report or deviations
observed in prior engagements may, however, be considered in assessing risk
and lead the service auditor to increase the extent of testing during the current
period.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A49</b> Generally, a type 2 report(s) is most useful to user entities and their
auditors when it covers a substantial portion of the period covered by the user
entity's financial statements being audited.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A50</b> Determining the effect of changes in the service organization's con-
trols that were implemented during the period covered by the service audi-
tor's report involves gathering information about the nature and extent of such
changes, how they affect processing at the service organization, and how they
might affect assertions in the user entities' financial statements.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A51</b>Certain controls may not leave evidence of their operation that can
be tested at a later date and, accordingly, the service auditor may find it ap-
propriate to test the operating effectiveness of such controls at various times
throughout the reporting period.</p>

Organization (Ref: par. .30)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A52</b> The following are examples of information produced by a service or-
ganization that are commonly used by a service auditor:
<ul>
	<li>Population lists the service auditor uses to select a sample of items

The cri-
teria used for engagements to report on controls at a service organization are
relevant only for the purpose of providing information about the service orga-
nization's system, including controls, to those who have an understanding of
how the system is used for financial reporting by user entities and, accordingly,
the service auditor's report states that the report and the description of tests of
controls are intended only for use by management of the service organization,
user entities of the service organization ("during some or all of the period cov-
ered by the service auditor's report" for a type 2 report, and "as of the specified

of the report.)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A68</b> Section 205 indicates that the need for restriction on the use of a

(vi) indicates that one of the preconditions for a service audi-

accept responsibility for providing a written assertion that accompanies man-

dicates that the service organization has the option of attaching the assertion
to the description of the service organization's system or including it in the de-

ple, through the use of headings. Segregating the assertion from the description
clarifies that the assertion is not part of the description.</p>
