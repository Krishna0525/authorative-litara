<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement on Standards for Tax
Services No. 3, Certain Procedural
Aspects of Preparing Returns</b>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. </b>This statement sets forth the applicable standards for members
concerning the obligation to examine or verify certain supporting
data or to consider information related to another taxpayer when preparing
a taxpayers tax return.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. </b>TIn preparing or signing a return, a member may in good faith
rely, without verification, on information furnished by the taxpayer or
by third parties. However, a member should not ignore the implications
of information furnished and should make reasonable inquiries
if the information furnished appears to be incorrect, incomplete, or
inconsistent either on its face or on the basis of other facts known to
the member. Further, a member should refer to the taxpayers returns
for one or more prior years whenever feasible.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. </b>If the tax law or regulations impose a condition with respect
to deductibility or other tax treatment of an item, such as taxpayer
maintenance of books and records or substantiating documentation
to support the reported deduction or tax treatment, a member should
make appropriate inquiries to determine to the members satisfaction
whether such condition has been met.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. </b>When preparing a tax return, a member should consider
information actually known to that member from the tax return of
another taxpayer if the information is relevant to that tax return and its
consideration is necessary to properly prepare that tax return. In using
such information, a member should consider any limitations imposed
by any law or rule relating to confidentiality.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. </b>The preparers declaration on a tax return often states that the
information contained therein is true, correct, and complete to the
best of the preparers knowledge and belief based on all information
known by the preparer. This type of reference should be understood
to include information furnished by the taxpayer or by third parties to
a member in connection with the preparation of the return.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. </b>The preparers declaration does not require a member to
examine or verify supporting data; a member may rely on information
furnished by the taxpayer unless it appears to be incorrect,
incomplete, or inconsistent. However, there is a need to determine
by inquiry that a specifically required condition, such as maintaining
books and records or substantiating documentation, has been satisfied
and to obtain information when the material furnished appears to be
incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent. Although a member has certain
responsibilities in exercising due diligence in preparing a return, the
taxpayer has the ultimate responsibility for the contents of the return.
Thus, if the taxpayer presents unsupported data in the form of lists of
tax information, such as dividends and interest received, charitable
contributions, and medical expenses, such information may be used
in the preparation of a tax return without verification unless it appears
to be incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent either on its face or on the
basis of other facts known to a member.
</p>


<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7. </b>Even though there is no requirement to examine underlying
documentation, a member should encourage the taxpayer to provide
supporting data where appropriate. For example, a member should
encourage the taxpayer to submit underlying documents for use in tax
return preparation to permit full consideration of income and deductions
arising from security transactions and from pass-through entities,
such as estates, trusts, partnerships, and S corporations.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">8. </b>The source of information provided to a member by a taxpayer
for use in preparing the return is often a pass-through entity, such as
a limited partnership, in which the taxpayer has an interest but is not
involved in management. A member may accept the information provided
by the pass-through entity without further inquiry, unless there
is reason to believe it is incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent, either
on its face or on the basis of other facts known to the member. In some instances, it may be appropriate for a member to advise the taxpayer to
ascertain the nature and amount of possible exposure to tax deficiencies,
interest, and penalties by taxpayer contact with management of
the pass-through entity.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">9. </b>A member should make use of a taxpayers returns for one or
more prior years in preparing the current return whenever feasible.
Reference to prior returns and discussion of prior-year tax determinations
with the taxpayer should provide information to determine
the taxpayers general tax status, avoid the omission or duplication of
items, and afford a basis for the treatment of similar or related transactions.
As with the examination of information supplied for the current
years return, the extent of comparison of the details of income and
deduction between years depends on the particular circumstances.
