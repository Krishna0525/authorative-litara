Item 303 of Regulation S-K, as interpreted by FRR No. 36, Item 303 of
Regulation S-B for small business issuers, and Item 9 of Form 20-F for Foreign
Private Issuers, provide the relevant rules and regulations adopted by the SEC
that meet the definition of suitable criteria in paragraphs .23–.32 of section

the financial statements for at least the latest period to which the MD&A presentation relates and the financial statements for the other periods
covered by the MD&A presentation have been audited by the practitioner or a
predecessor auditor. A base knowledge of the entity and its operations gained
through an audit of the historical financial statements and knowledge about the

<p>A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making in-
quiries of persons responsible for financial, accounting, and operational mat-
ters. A review ordinarily does not contemplate (
a
) tests of accounting records
through inspection, observation, or confirmation, (

) obtaining corroborating
evidential matter in response to inquiries, or (
c
) the application of certain
other procedures ordinarily performed during an examination of MD&A. A re-
view may bring to the practitioner's attention significant matters affecting the MD&A, but it does not provide assurance that the practitioner will become
aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination.</p>

statements for the other periods covered by the MD&A presentation have been
audited by the practitioner or a predecessor auditor.

<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .15 </b> In determining whether to accept an engagement, the practitioner
should consider whether management (and others engaged by management to
assist them, such as legal counsel) has the appropriate knowledge of the rules
and regulations adopted by the SEC to prepare MD&A.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responsibilities of Management</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .16 </b>Management is responsible for the preparation of the entity's MD&A
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. The preparation
of MD&A in conformity with the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC requires management to interpret the criteria, accurately derive the historical
amounts from the entity's books and records, make determinations as to the
relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions
that affect reported information.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .17 </b>An entity should not name the practitioner in a client-prepared docu-
ment as having examined or reviewed MD&A unless the MD&A presentation
and related practitioner's report and the related financial statements and au-
ditor's (or accountant's review) report are included in the document (or, in the
case of a public entity, incorporated by reference to such information filed with
a regulatory agency). If such a statement is made in a document that does not
include (or incorporate by reference) such information, the practitioner should
request that neither his or her name nor reference to the practitioner be made
with respect to the MD&A information, or that such document be revised to in-
clude the required presentations and reports. If the client does not comply, the
practitioner should advise the client that he or she does not consent to either
the use of his or her name or the reference to the practitioner, and he or she
should consider what other actions might be appropriate.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obtaining an Understanding of the SEC Rules and Regulations
and Management’s Methodology for the Preparation of MD&A</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .18 </b> The practitioner should obtain an understanding of the rules and reg-
ulations adopted by the SEC for MD&A. (Refer to paragraph .04.)</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .19 </b> The practitioner should inquire of management regarding the method
of preparing MD&A, including matters such as the sources of the information,
how the information is gathered, how management evaluates the types of fac-
tors having a material effect on financial condition (including liquidity and cap-
ital resources), results of operations, and cash flows, and whether there have
been any changes in the procedures from the prior year.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of Procedures</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .20 </b> Proper planning by the practitioner contributes to the effectiveness of
the attest procedures in an examination or a review of MD&A. Performing some
of the work in conjunction with the audit of the historical financial statements
or the review of interim financial statements may permit the work to be carried
out in a more efficient manner and to be completed at an earlier date. When
performing an examination or a review of MD&A, the practitioner may consider
the results of tests of controls, analytical procedures,
16
and substantive tests
performed in a financial statement audit or analytical procedures and inquiries
made in a review of financial statements or interim financial information.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Materiality</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .21 </b> The practitioner should consider the concept of materiality in planning
and performing the engagement. The objective of an examination or a review is
to report on the MD&A presentation taken as a whole and not on the individual
amounts and disclosures contained therein. In the context of an MD&A pre-
sentation, the concept of materiality encompasses both material omissions (for
example, the omission of trends, events, and uncertainties that are currently
known to management that are reasonably likely to have material effects on the
entity's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources)
and material misstatements in MD&A, both of which are referred to herein as
a misstatement. Assessing the significance of a misstatement of some items in
MD&A may be more dependent upon qualitative than quantitative considera-
tions. Qualitative aspects of materiality relate to the relevance and reliability of
the information presented (for example, qualitative aspects of materiality are
considered in assessing whether the underlying information, determinations,
estimates, and assumptions of the entity provide a reasonable basis for the dis-
closures in the MD&A). Furthermore, quantitative information is often more
meaningful when accompanied by qualitative disclosures. For example, quan-
titative information about market risk-sensitive instruments is more mean-
ingful when accompanied by qualitative information about an entity's market
risk exposures and how those exposures are managed. Materiality is also a
concept that is judged in light of the expected range of reasonableness of the
information; therefore, users should not expect prospective information (infor-
mation about events that have not yet occurred) to be as precise as historical
information.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .22 </b> In expressing an opinion, or providing the limited assurance of a review
engagement, on the presentation, the practitioner should consider the omission
or misstatement of an individual assertion (see paragraph .34) to be material
if the magnitude of the omission or misstatement—individually or when ag-
gregated with other omissions or misstatements—is such that a reasonable
person using the MD&A presentation would be influenced by the inclusion or
correction of the individual assertion. The relative rather than absolute size of
an omission or misstatement may determine whether it is material in a given
situation.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inclusion of Pro Forma Financial Information</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .23 </b>Management may include pro forma financial information with respect
to a business combination or other transactions in MD&A. The practitioner
should consider the guidance in paragraph .10 of section 401,
Reporting on
Pro Forma Financial Information
, when performing procedures with respect
to such information, even if management indicates in MD&A that certain in-
formation has been derived from unaudited financial statements. For example,
in an examination of MD&A, the practitioner's procedures would ordinarily in-
clude obtaining an understanding of the underlying transaction or event, dis-
cussing with management their assumptions, obtaining sufficient evidence in
support of the adjustments, and other procedures for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the MD&A presentation taken as a whole and not for expressing
an opinion on (or providing the limited assurance of a review of) the pro forma
financial information included therein under section 401.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inclusion of External Information</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .24 </b>An entity may also include in its MD&A information external to the
entity, such as the rating of its debt by certain rating agencies or comparisons with statistics from a trade association. Such external information should also
be subjected to the practitioner's examination or review procedures. For exam-
ple, in an examination, the practitioner might compare information concern-
ing the statistics of a trade organization to a published source; however, the
practitioner would not be expected to test the underlying support for the trade
association's calculation of such statistics.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inclusion of Forward-Looking Information</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .25 </b>An entity may include certain forward-looking disclosures in the
MD&A presentation, including cautionary language concerning the achievabil-
ity of the matters disclosed. Although any forward-looking disclosures that are
included in the MD&A presentation should be subjected to the practitioner's
examination or review, such information is subjected to testing only for the
purpose of expressing an opinion that the underlying information, determina-
tions, estimates, and assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the disclosures
contained therein or providing the limited assurance of a review on the MD&A
presentation taken as a whole. The practitioner may consider the guidance in
section 301,
Financial Forecasts and Projections
, when performing procedures
with respect to forward-looking information. The practitioner may also consider
whether meaningful cautionary language has been included with the forward-
looking information.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .26 </b>Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act) provide a safe harbor
from liability in private litigation with respect to forward-looking statements
that include or make reference to meaningful cautionary language. However,
such sections also include exclusions from safe harbor protection in certain sit-
uations. Whether an entity's forward-looking statements and the practitioner's
report thereon qualify for safe harbor protection is a legal matter.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inclusion of Voluntary Information</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .27 </b>An entity may voluntarily include other information in the MD&A pre-
sentation that is not required by the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC
for MD&A. When the entity includes in MD&A additional information required
by other rules and regulations of the SEC (for example, Item 305 of Regulation
S-K,
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
), the practi-
tioner should also consider such other rules and regulations in subjecting such
information to his or her examination or review procedures.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examination Engagement</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .28 </b>To express an opinion about whether (
a
) the presentation includes,
in all material respects, the required elements of the rules and regulations
adopted by the SEC, (
b
) the historical financial amounts have been accurately
derived, in all material respects, from the entity's financial statements, and
(
c
) the underlying information, determinations, estimates, and assumptions of
the entity provide a reasonable basis for the disclosures contained therein, the
practitioner seeks to obtain reasonable assurance by accumulating sufficient
evidence in support of the disclosures and assumptions, thereby restricting at-
testation risk to an appropriately low level.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examination Engagement</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .29 </b>In an engagement to examine MD&A, the practitioner plans and per-
forms the examination to obtain reasonable assurance of detecting both inten-
tional and unintentional misstatements that are material to the MD&A pre-
sentation taken as a whole. Absolute assurance is not attainable because of
factors such as the need for judgment regarding the areas to be tested and
the nature, timing, and extent of tests to be performed; the concept of selective
testing of the data; and the inherent limitations of the controls applicable to
the preparation of MD&A. The practitioner exercises professional judgment in
assessing the significant determinations made by management as to the rele-
vancy of information to be included, and the estimates and assumptions that
affect reported information. As a result of these factors, in the great majority
of cases, the practitioner has to rely on evidence that is persuasive rather than
convincing. Also, procedures may be ineffective for detecting an intentional mis-
statement that is concealed through collusion among client personnel and third
parties or among management or employees of the client. Therefore, the sub-
sequent discovery that a material misstatement exists in the MD&A does not,
in and of itself, evidence (
a
) failure to obtain reasonable assurance; (
b
) inade-
quate planning, performance, or judgment on the part of the practitioner; (
c
)
the absence of due professional care; or (
d
) a failure to comply with this section.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .30 </b>Factors to be considered by the practitioner in planning an examina-
tion of MD&A include (
a
) the anticipated level of attestation risk related to as-
sertions embodied in the MD&A presentation, (
b
) preliminary judgments about
materiality for attest purposes, (
c
) the items within the MD&A presentation
that are likely to require revision or adjustment, and (
d
) conditions that may
require extension or modification of attest procedures. For purposes of an en-
gagement to examine MD&A, the components of attestation risk are defined as
follows.
<ol type="a">
	<li>inherent risk
is the susceptibility of an assertion within MD&A
to a material misstatement, assuming that there are no related
controls. (See paragraphs .34–.38.)</li>
	<li>control risk
is the risk that a material misstatement that could
occur in an assertion within MD&A will not be prevented or de-
tected on a timely basis by the entity's controls; some control risk
will always exist because of the inherent limitations of any inter-
nal control.</li>
	<li>Detection risk
is the risk that the practitioner will not detect a
material misstatement that exists in an assertion within MD&A.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Inherent Risk</i></b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .31 </b>The level of inherent risk varies with the nature of the assertion. For
example, the inherent risk concerning financial information included in the
MD&A presentation may be low, whereas the inherent risk concerning the com-
pleteness of the disclosure of the entity's risks or liquidity may be high.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Control Risk</i></b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .32 </b>The practitioner should assess control risk as discussed in paragraphs
.53–.57. Assessing control risk contributes to the practitioner's evaluation of
the risk that material misstatement in the MD&A exists. In the process of as-
sessing control risk (together with assessing inherent risk), the practitioner
may obtain evidential matter about the risk that such misstatement may exist.
The practitioner uses this evidential matter as part of the reasonable basis for
his or her opinion on the MD&A presentation taken as a whole.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Detection Risk</i></b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .33 </b>In determining an acceptable level of detection risk, the practitioner
assesses inherent risk and control risk, and considers the extent to which he
or she seeks to restrict attestation risk. As assessed inherent risk or control
risk decreases, the acceptable level of detection risk increases. Accordingly, the
practitioner may alter the nature, timing, and extent of tests performed based
on the assessments of inherent risk and control risk.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Detection Risk</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .34 </b>Assertions are representations by management that are embodied in
the MD&A presentation. They can be either explicit or implicit and can be clas-

	<li>Reported transactions, events, and explanations are consistent
with the financial statements.</li>
	<li>Historical financial amounts have been accurately derived from
the financial statements and related records.</li>
	<li>Nonfinancial data have been accurately derived from related
records.</li>
</ol>

<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .36 </b>Assertions about completeness address whether descriptions of trans-
actions and events necessary to obtain an understanding of the entity's fi-
nancial condition (including liquidity and capital resources), changes in finan-
cial condition, results of operations, and material commitments for capital re-
sources are included in MD&A; and whether known events, transactions, condi-
tions, trends, demands, commitments, or uncertainties that will result in or are
reasonably likely to result in material changes to these items are appropriately
described in the MD&A presentation.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .37 </b>For example, if management asserts that the reason for an increase in
revenues is a price increase in the current year, they are explicitly asserting
that both an increase in revenues and a price increase have occurred in the
current year, and implicitly asserting that any historical financial amounts in-
cluded are consistent with the financial statements for such period. They are
also implicitly asserting that the explanation for the increase in revenues is
complete; that there are no other significant reasons for the increase in rev-
enues.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .38 </b>Assertions about presentation and disclosure address whether infor-
mation included in the MD&A presentation is properly classified, described,
and disclosed. For example, management asserts that any forward-looking in-
formation included in MD&A is properly classified as being based on manage-
ment's present assessment and includes an appropriate description of the ex-
pected results. To further disclose the nature of such information, management
may also include a statement that actual results in the future may differ ma-
terially from management's present assessment. (See paragraphs .25–.26.)</div>

. Although
procedures designed to achieve the practitioner's objective of forming an opin-
ion on the MD&A presentation taken as a whole may test certain assertions
embodied in the underlying financial statements, the practitioner is not ex-
pected to test the underlying financial statement assertions in an examination
of MD&A. For example, the practitioner is not expected to test the completeness
of revenues or the existence of inventory when testing the assertions in MD&A
concerning an increase in revenues or an increase in inventory levels; assur-
ance related to completeness of revenues or for existence of inventory would
be obtained as part of the audit. The practitioner is, however, responsible for
testing the completeness of the explanation for the increase in revenues or the
increase in inventory levels. [Revised, December 2012, to reflect conforming

<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .42 </b>Planning an engagement to examine MD&A involves developing an
overall strategy for the expected scope and performance of the engagement.
<p>When developing an overall strategy for the engagement, the practitioner
should consider factors such as the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Matters affecting the industry in which the entity operates, such
as financial reporting practices, economic conditions, laws and reg-
ulations, and technological changes</li>
	<li>Knowledge of the entity's internal control applicable to the prepa-
ration of MD&A obtained during the audit of the financial state-
ments and the extent of recent changes, if any</li>
	<li>Matters relating to the entity's business, including its organiza-
tion, operating characteristics, capital structure, and distribution
methods</li>
	<li>The types of relevant information that management reports to ex-
ternal analysts (for example, press releases and presentations to
lenders and rating agencies, if any, concerning past and future per-
formance)</li>
	<li>How the entity analyzes actual performance compared to budgets
and the types of information provided in documents submitted to
the board of directors for purposes of the entity's day-to-day oper-
ations and long-range planning</li>
	<li>The extent of management's knowledge of and experience with the
rules and regulations adopted by the SEC for MD&A</li>
	<li>If the entity is a nonpublic entity, the intended use of the MD&A
presentation</li>
	<li>Preliminary judgments about (
a
) materiality, (
b
) inherent risk at
the individual assertion level, and (
c
) factors (for example, mat-
ters identified during the audit or review of the historical financial
statements) relating to significant deficiencies in internal control
applicable to the preparation of MD&A (See paragraph .58.)</li>
	<li>The fraud risk factors or other conditions identified during the au-
dit of the most recent annual financial statements and the practi-
tioner's response to such risk factors</li>
	<li>The type and extent of evidential matter supporting manage-
ment's assertions and disclosures in the MD&A presentation</li>
	<li>The nature of complex or subjective matters potentially material
to the MD&A presentation that may require special skill or knowl-
edge and whether such matters may require using the work of
a specialist to obtain sufficient evidential matter (See paragraph
.47.)</li>
	<li>The presence of an internal audit function (See paragraph .48.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .43 </b>In planning an engagement when MD&A has not previously been ex-
amined, the practitioner should consider the degree to which the entity has
information available for such prior periods and the continuity of the entity's
personnel and their ability to respond to inquiries with respect to such periods.
In addition, the practitioner should obtain an understanding of the entity's in-
ternal control in prior years applicable to the preparation of MD&A.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Consideration of Audit Results</i></b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .44 </b>The practitioner should also consider the results of the audits of the
financial statements for the periods covered by the MD&A presentation on the
examination engagement, such as matters relating to the following:
<ul>
	<li>The availability and condition of the entity's records</li>
	<li>The nature and magnitude of audit adjustments</li>
	<li>Misstatements
18
that were not corrected in the financial state-
ments that may affect MD&A disclosures (for example, misclassi-
fications between financial statement line items)</li>
<p>[Revised, December 2012, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the
issuance of SAS Nos. 122–126.]</p>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .45 </b>The practitioner should also consider the possible impact on the scope
of the examination engagement of any modification or contemplated modifica-
tion of the auditor's report, including matters addressed in explanatory lan-
guage. For example, if the auditor has modified the auditor's report to include a
going-concern uncertainty explanatory paragraph, the practitioner would con-
sider such a matter in assessing attestation risk.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Multiple Components</i></b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .46 </b>In an engagement to examine MD&A, if the entity has operations
in several components (for example, locations, branches, subsidiaries, or pro-
grams), the practitioner examining the group's MD&A should determine the
components to which procedures should be applied. In making such a determi-
nation and in selecting the components to be tested, the practitioner examining
the group's MD&A should consider factors such as the following:
<ul>
	<li>The relative importance of each component to the applicable dis-
closure in the group's MD&A</li>
<li>The degree of centralization of records</li>
<li>The effectiveness of controls, particularly those that affect group
management's direct control over the exercise of authority dele-
gated to others and its ability to supervise activities at various
locations effectively</li>
<li>The nature and extent of operations conducted at the various com-
ponents</li>
<li>The similarity of operations and internal control for different com-
ponents</li>
</ul>
<p>The practitioner examining the group's MD&A should consider whether the
audit base of the components is consistent with the components that are dis-
closed in MD&A Accordingly, it may be desirable for the practitioner examining
the group's MD&A to coordinate the audit work with the components that will
be disclosed. [Revised, December 2012, to reflect conforming changes necessary

</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Using the Work of a Specialist</i></b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .47 </b>In some engagements to examine MD&A, the nature of complex or sub-
jective matters potentially material to the MD&A presentation may require
specialized skill or knowledge in a particular field other than accounting or
auditing. For example, the entity may include information concerning plant
production capacity, which would ordinarily be determined by an engineer. In such cases, the practitioner may use the work of a specialist and should con-
sider the relevant guidance in AU-C section 620,
Using the Work of an Auditor's
Specialist
. An auditor's specialist may be either an auditor's internal specialist
(for example, a partner of the auditor's firm) or an external specialist. [Revised,
December 2012, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of
SAS Nos. 122–126.]</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Internal Audit Function</i></b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .48 </b>Another factor the practitioner should consider when planning the en-
gagement is whether the entity has an internal audit function and the extent
to which internal auditors are involved in directly testing the MD&A presen-
tation, in monitoring the entity's internal control applicable to the preparation
of MD&A, or in testing the underlying records supporting disclosures in the
MD&A. A practitioner should consider the guidance in AU-C section 610,
The
Auditor's Consideration of the Internal Audit Function in an Audit of Financial
Statements
, when addressing the competence and objectivity of internal audi-
tors; the nature, timing, and extent of work to be performed; and other related
matters. [Revised, December 2012, to reflect conforming changes necessary due
to the issuance of SAS Nos. 122–126.]</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consideration of Internal Control Applicable to the
Preparation of MD&A</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .49 </b>The practitioner should obtain an understanding of the entity's inter-
nal control applicable to the preparation of MD&A sufficient to plan the en-
gagement and to assess control risk. Generally, controls that are relevant to an
examination pertain to the entity's objective of preparing MD&A in conformity
with the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, and may include controls
within the control environment, risk assessment, information and communica-
tion, control activities, and monitoring components.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .50 </b>The controls relating to operations and compliance objectives may be
relevant to an examination if they pertain to data the practitioner evaluates or
uses in applying examination procedures. For example, controls over the gath-
ering of information, which are different from financial statement controls, and
controls relating to nonfinancial data that are included in the MD&A presen-
tation, may be relevant to an examination engagement.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .51 </b>The controls relating to operations and compliance objectives may be
relevant to an examination if they pertain to data the practitioner evaluates or
uses in applying examination procedures. For example, controls over the gath-
ering of information, which are different from financial statement controls, and
controls relating to nonfinancial data that are included in the MD&A presen-
tation, may be relevant to an examination engagement.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .52 </b>A practitioner generally obtains an understanding of the design of the
entity's internal control applicable to the preparation of MD&A by making in-
quiries of appropriate management, supervisory, and staff personnel; by inspec-
tion of the entity's documents; and by observation of the entity's relevant ac-
tivities, including controls over matters discussed, nonfinancial data included,
and management evaluation of the reasonableness of information included. The
nature and extent of procedures a practitioner performs vary from entity to en-
tity and are influenced by factors such as the entity's complexity, the length of
time that the entity has prepared MD&A pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted by the SEC, the practitioner's knowledge of the entity's controls ob-
tained in audits and previous professional engagements, and judgments about
materiality.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .53 </b>After obtaining an understanding of the entity's internal control ap-
plicable to the preparation of MD&A, the practitioner assesses control risk for
the assertions embodied in the MD&A presentation. (Refer to paragraphs .34–
.39.) The practitioner may assess control risk at the maximum level (the great-
est probability that a material misstatement that could occur in an assertion
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by an entity's controls) be-
cause the practitioner believes controls are unlikely to pertain to an assertion,
are unlikely to be effective, or because evaluating their effectiveness would be
inefficient. Alternatively, the practitioner may obtain evidential matter about
the effectiveness of both the design and operation of a control that supports a
lower assessed level of control risk. Such evidential matter may be obtained
from tests of controls planned and performed concurrently with obtaining the
understanding of the internal control or from procedures performed to obtain
the understanding that were not specifically planned as tests of controls.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .54 </b>After obtaining the understanding and assessing control risk, the prac-
titioner may desire to seek a further reduction in the assessed level of control
risk for certain assertions. In such cases, the practitioner considers whether ev-
idential matter sufficient to support a further reduction is likely to be available
and whether performing additional tests of controls to obtain such evidential
matter would be efficient.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .55 </b>When seeking to assess control risk below the maximum for controls
over financial and nonfinancial data, the practitioner should perform tests of
controls to obtain evidence to support the assessed level of control risk. For
example, the practitioner may perform tests of controls directed toward the ef-
fectiveness of the design or operation of internal control over the accumulation
of the number of units sold for a manufacturing company, average interest rates
earned and paid for a financial institution, or average net sales per square foot
for a retail entity.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .56 </b>The practitioner uses the knowledge provided by the understanding of
internal control applicable to the preparation of MD&A and the assessed level
of control risk in determining the nature, timing, and extent of substantive tests
for the MD&A assertions.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .57 </b>The practitioner should document the understanding of the internal
control components obtained to plan the examination and the assessment of
control risk. The form and extent of this documentation is influenced by the
size and complexity of the entity, as well as the nature of the entity's controls
applicable to the preparation of MD&A.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .58 </b>During the course of an engagement to examine MD&A, the practi-
tioner may become aware of control deficiencies in the design or operation of
controls applicable to the preparation of MD&A that could adversely affect the
entity's ability to prepare MD&A in accordance with the rules and regulations
adopted by the SEC. The practitioner should consider the implications of such
control deficiencies on his or her ability to rely on management's explanations
and on comparisons to summary accounting records. A practitioner's responsi-
bility to communicate these control deficiencies in an examination of MD&A is
similar to the auditor's responsibility described in AU-C section 265,
Commu-
nicating Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an Audit
,andAU-Csec-
tion 260,

flect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SAS Nos. 122–126.]</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obtaining Sufficient Evidence</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .59 </b>The practitioner should apply procedures to obtain reasonable assur-
ance of detecting material misstatements. In an audit of historical financial
statements, the practitioner will have applied audit procedures to some of the
information included in the MD&A. However, because the objective of those
audit procedures is to have a reasonable basis for expressing an opinion on
the financial statements taken as a whole rather than on the MD&A, certain
additional examination procedures should be performed as discussed in para-
graphs .60–.64. Determining these procedures and evaluating the sufficiency
of the evidence obtained are matters of professional judgment.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .60 </b>The practitioner ordinarily should apply the following procedures.
	<li>Read the MD&A and compare the content for consistency with
the audited financial statements; compare financial amounts to
the audited financial statements or related accounting records
and analyses; recompute the increases, decreases, and percent-
ages disclosed.</li>
	<li>Compare nonfinancial amounts to the audited financial state-
ments, if applicable, or to other records. (Refer to paragraphs .62–
.64.)</li>
	<li>Consider whether the explanations in MD&A are consistent with
the information obtained during the audit; investigate further
those explanations that cannot be substantiated by information
in the audit working papers through inquiry (including inquiry of
officers and other executives having responsibility for operational
areas) and inspection of client records.</li>
	<li>Examine internally generated documents (for example, variance
analyses, sales analyses, wage cost analyses, sales or service pric-
ing sheets, and business plans or programs) and externally gener-
ated documents (for example, correspondence, contracts, or loan
agreements) in support of the existence, occurrence, or expected
occurrence of events, transactions, conditions, trends, demands,
commitments, and uncertainties disclosed in the MD&A.</li>
	<li>Obtain available prospective financial information (for example,
budgets; sales forecasts; forecasts of labor, overhead, and materi-
als costs; capital expenditure requests; and financial forecasts and
projections) and compare such information to forward-looking
MD&A disclosures. Inquire of management as to the procedures
used to prepare the prospective financial information. Evaluate
whether the underlying information, determinations, estimates,
and assumptions of the entity provide a reasonable basis for the
MD&A disclosures of events, transactions, conditions, trends, de-
mands, commitments, or uncertainties.</li>
	<li>Consider obtaining available prospective financial information
relating to prior periods and comparing actual results with fore-
casted and projected amounts.</li>
	<li>Make inquiries of officers and other executives having responsi-
bility for operational areas (such as sales, marketing, and produc-
tion) and financial and accounting matters, as to their plans and expectations for the future that could affect the entity's liquidity
and capital resources.</li>
	<li>Consider obtaining external information concerning industry
trends, inflation, and changing prices and comparing the related
MD&A disclosures to such information.</li>
	<li>Compare the information in MD&A with the rules and regula-
tions adopted by the SEC and consider whether the presentation
includes the required elements of such rules and regulations.</li>
	<li>Read the minutes of meetings to date of the board of directors
and other significant committees to identify matters that may af-
fect MD&A; consider whether such matters are appropriately ad-
dressed in MD&A.</li>
	<li>Inquire of officers as to the entity's prior experience with the SEC
and the extent of comments received upon review of documents
by the SEC; read correspondence between the entity and the SEC
with respect to such review, if any.</li>
	<li>Obtain public communications (for example, press releases and
quarterly reports) and the related supporting documentation
dealing with historical and future results; consider whether
MD&A is consistent with such communications.</li>
	<li>Consider obtaining other types of publicly available information
(for example, analyst reports and news articles); compare the
MD&A presentation with such information.</li>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Testing Completeness</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .61 </b>The practitioner should design procedures to test the presentation for
completeness, including tests of the completeness of explanations that relate
to historical disclosures as discussed in paragraphs .36–.37. The practitioner
should also consider whether the MD&A discloses matters that could signifi-
cantly impact future financial condition and results of operations of the entity
by considering information that he or she obtained through the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>Audit of the financial statements</li>
	<li>Inquiries of the entity's officers and other executives directed to
current events, conditions, economic changes, commitments and
uncertainties, within both the entity and its industry</li>
	<li>Other information obtained through procedures such as those
listed in paragraphs .60 and .65–.66</li>
</ol>
<p>As discussed in paragraph .31, the inherent risk concerning the completeness
of disclosures may be high; if it is, the practitioner may extend the procedures
(for example, by making additional inquiries of management or by examining
additional internally generated documents).</p>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Nonfinancial Data</i></b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .62 </b>Management may include nonfinancial data (such as units produced;
the number of units sold, locations, or customers; plant utilization; or square
footage) in the MD&A. The practitioner should consider whether the defini-
tions used by management for such nonfinancial data are reasonable for the
particular disclosure in the MD&A and whether there are suitable criteria (for
example, industry standards with respect to square footage for retail opera-
tions), as discussed in paragraphs .23–.32 of section 101.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .63 </b>In some situations, the nonfinancial data or the controls over the non-
financial data may have been tested by the practitioner in conjunction with the financial statement audit; however, the practitioner's consideration of the
nature of the procedures to apply to nonfinancial data in an examination of
MD&A is based on the concept of materiality with respect to the MD&A presen-
tation. The practitioner should consider whether industry standards exist for
the nonfinancial data or whether there are different methods of measurement
that may be used, and, if such methods could result in significantly different
results, whether the method of measurement selected by management is rea-
sonable and consistent between periods covered by the MD&A presentation.
For example, the number of customers reported by management could vary de-
pending on whether management defines a customer as a subsidiary or "ship
to" location of a company rather than the company itself.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .64 </b>In testing nonfinancial data included in the MD&A, the practitioner
may seek to assess control risk below the maximum for controls over such non-
financial data, as discussed in paragraph .55. The practitioner weighs the in-
crease in effort of the examination associated with the additional tests of con-
trols that is necessary to obtain evidential matter against the resulting de-
crease in examination effort associated with the reduced substantive tests. For
those nonfinancial assertions for which the practitioner performs additional
tests of controls, the practitioner determines the assessed level of control risk
that the results of those tests will support. This assessed level of control risk is
used in determining the appropriate detection risk to accept for those nonfinan-
cial assertions and, accordingly, in determining the nature, timing, and extent
of substantive tests for such assertions.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consideration of the Effect of Events Subsequent to the
Balance-Sheet Date</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .65 </b>As there is an expectation by the SEC that MD&A considers events
through a date at or near the filing date,
20
the practitioner should consider in-
formation about events
21
that comes to his or her attention after the end of the
period addressed by MD&A and prior to the issuance of his or her report that
may have a material effect on the entity's financial condition (including liquid-
ity and capital resources), changes in financial condition, results of operations,
and material commitments for capital resources. Events or matters that should
be disclosed in MD&A include those that—
<ul>
	<li>Are reasonably expected to have a material favorable or unfavor-
able impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing
operations.</li>
	<li>Are reasonably likely to result in the entity's liquidity increasing
or decreasing in any material way.</li>
	<li>Will have a material effect on the entity's capital resources.</li>
	<li>Would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily
indicative of future operating results or of future financial condi-
tion.</li>
<p>The practitioner should consider whether events identified during the examina-
tion of the MD&A presentation or the audit of the related financial statements
require adjustment to or disclosure in the MD&A presentation. When MD&A
will be included or incorporated by reference in a 1933 Act document that is
filed with the SEC, the practitioner's procedures should extend up to the filing
date or as close to it as is reasonable and practicable in the circumstances.
23
If
a public entity's MD&A presentation is to be included only in a filing under the
1934 Act (for example, Forms 10-K or 10-KSB), the practitioner's responsibility
to consider subsequent events does not extend beyond the date of the report on
MD&A. Paragraphs .94–.98 provide guidance when the practitioner is engaged
subsequent to the filing of the MD&A presentation</p>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .66 </b>In an examination of MD&A, the practitioner's fieldwork ordinarily
extends beyond the date of the auditor's report on the related financial state-
ments.
24
Accordingly, the practitioner generally should—
<ol type="a">
	<li>Read available minutes of meetings of stockholders, the board of
directors, and other appropriate committees; as to meetings for
which minutes are not available, inquire about matters dealt with

a
) the MD&A presentation
does not include, in all material respects, the required elements of the rules and
regulations adopted by the SEC, (

therein have not been accurately derived, in all material respects, from the en-

standing presentation or it may be combined with the MD&A presentation for
the most recent fiscal year. Procedures for conducting a review of MD&A gener-
ally are limited to inquiries and analytical procedures, rather than also includ-
ing search and verification procedures, concerning factors that have a material
effect on financial condition, including liquidity and capital resources, results of
operations, and cash flows. In a review engagement, the practitioner should—
<ol type="a">

by the SEC for MD&A and management's method of preparing
MD&A. (See paragraphs .18–.19.)</li>
	<li>Plan the engagement. (See paragraph .77.)</li>

of MD&A is similar to the practitioner's consideration in an ex-
amination. (See paragraphs .65–.66.)</li>
	<li>Obtain written representations from management concerning its
responsibility for MD&A, completeness of minutes, events subse-
quent to the balance-sheet date, and other matters about which
the practitioner believes written representations are appropriate.

as financial reporting practices, economic conditions, laws and reg-
ulations, and technological changes</li>
	<li>Matters relating to the entity's business, including its organiza-

cient knowledge of the entity's internal control applicable to the preparation of
MD&A to—
<ul>
	<li>Identify types of potential misstatements in MD&A, including
types of material omissions, and consider the likelihood of their
occurrence.</li>

the following analytical procedures and inquiries.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Read the MD&A presentation and compare the content for con-
sistency with the audited financial statements (or reviewed in-
terim financial information if MD&A includes interim informa-
tion); compare financial amounts to the audited or reviewed fi-
nancial statements or related accounting records and analyses;
recompute the increases, decreases, and percentages disclosed.</li>
	<li>Compare nonfinancial amounts to the audited (or reviewed) fi-
nancial statements, if applicable, or to other records. (Refer to
paragraph .80.)</li>
	<li>Consider whether the explanations in MD&A are consistent with
the information obtained during the audit or the review of interim
financial information; make further inquiries of officers and other
executives having responsibility for operational areas as neces-
sary.</li>
	<li>Obtain available prospective financial information (for example,
budgets; sales forecasts; forecasts of labor, overhead, and materi-
als costs; capital expenditure requests; and financial forecasts and
projections) and compare such information to forward-looking
MD&A disclosures. Inquire of management as to the procedures
used to prepare the prospective financial information. Consider
whether information came to the practitioner's attention that
causes him or her to believe that the underlying information, de-
terminations, estimates, and assumptions of the entity do not pro-
vide a reasonable basis for the disclosures of trends, demands,
commitments, events, or uncertainties.
</li>
	<li>Make inquiries of officers and other executives having responsi-
bility for operational areas (such as sales, marketing, and produc-
tion) and financial and accounting matters, as to any plans and expectations for the future that could affect the entity's liquidity
and capital resources.</li>
	<li>Compare the information in MD&A with the rules and regula-
tions adopted by the SEC and consider whether the presentation
includes the required elements of such rules and regulations.</li>
	<li>Read the minutes of meetings to date of the board of directors
and other significant committees to identify actions that may af-
fect MD&A; consider whether such matters are appropriately ad-
dressed in the MD&A presentation.</li>
	<li>Inquire of officers as to the entity's prior experience with the SEC
and the extent of comments received upon review of documents
by the SEC; read correspondence between the entity and the SEC
with respect to such review, if any.</li>
	<li>Inquire of management regarding the nature of public communi-
cations (for example, press releases and quarterly reports) deal-
ing with historical and future results and consider whether the
MD&A presentation is consistent with such communications.</li>
</ol>

titioner should inquire as to the nature of the records from which such infor-

form other tests of such records beyond analytical procedures and inquiries of
individuals responsible for maintaining them. The practitioner should consider
whether such nonfinancial data are relevant to users of the MD&A presenta-

<div>

ter regarding the MD&A presentation. For example, he or she may wish to em-

should be presented in a separate paragraph of the practitioner's report.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combined Examination and Review Report on MD&A</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .92 </b>A practitioner may be engaged both to examine an MD&A presentation
as of the most recent fiscal year-end and to review a separate MD&A presen-
tation for a subsequent interim period. If the examination and review are com-
pleted at the same time, a combined report may be issued. Appendix C [para-
graph .116], "Combined Reports," contains an example of a combined report on
an examination of an annual MD&A presentation and the review of a separate
MD&A presentation for an interim period. (See Example 1.)</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .93 </b>If an entity prepares a combined MD&A presentation for annual and
interim periods in which there is a discussion of liquidity and capital resources
only as of the most recent interim period but not as of the most recent annual
period, the practitioner is limited to performing the highest level of service that
is provided with respect to the historical financial statements for any of the pe-
riods covered by the MD&A presentation. For example, if the annual financial
statements have been audited and the interim financial statements have been
reviewed, the practitioner may be engaged to perform a review of the combined
MD&A presentation. Appendix C [paragraph .116] contains an example of a re-
view report on a combined MD&A presentation for annual and interim periods.
(See Example 2.)</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Practitioner Is Engaged Subsequent to the
Filing of MD&A</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .94 </b>Management's responsibility for updating an MD&A presentation for
events occurring subsequent to the issuance of MD&A depends on whether the
entity is a public or nonpublic entity. A public entity is required to report sig-
nificant subsequent events in a Form 8-K or Form 10-Q, or in a registration statement; therefore, a public company would ordinarily not modify its MD&A
presentation once it is filed with the SEC (or other regulatory agency).</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .95 </b>Therefore, if the practitioner is engaged to examine (or review) an
MD&A presentation of a public entity that has already been filed with the SEC
(or other regulatory agency), the practitioner should consider whether mate-
rial subsequent events are appropriately disclosed in a Form 8-K or 10-Q, or a
registration statement that includes or incorporates by reference such MD&A
presentation. Refer to paragraphs .65–.66 for guidance concerning considera-
tion of events up to the filing date when the practitioner's report on MD&A will
be included (or incorporated by reference) in a 1933 Act document filed with
the SEC that will require a consent.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .96 </b>If subsequent events of a public entity are appropriately disclosed in a
Form 8-K or 10-Q, or in a registration statement, or if there have been no ma-
terial subsequent events, the practitioner should add the following paragraph
to his or her examination or review report following the opinion or concluding
paragraph, respectively.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .97 </b>If there has been a material subsequent event that has not been dis-
closed in a manner described in paragraph .95 and if the practitioner deter-
mines that it is appropriate to issue a report even though the MD&A presen-
tation has not been updated for such material subsequent event (for example,
because the filing of the Form 10-Q that will disclose such events has not yet
occurred), the practitioner should express a qualified or an adverse opinion (or
appropriately modify the review report) on the MD&A presentation. As dis-
cussed in paragraph .107, if such material subsequent event is not appropri-
ately disclosed, the practitioner should evaluate (
a
) whether to resign from the
engagement related to the MD&A presentation and (
b
) whether to remain as
the entity's auditor or stand for re-election to audit the entity's financial state-
ments.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .98 </b>Because a nonpublic entity is not subject to the filing requirements of
the SEC, an MD&A presentation of a nonpublic entity should be updated for
material subsequent events through the date of the practitioner's report.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a Predecessor Auditor Has Audited Prior Period
Financial Statements</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .99 </b>If a predecessor auditor has audited the financial statements for a prior
period covered by the MD&A, the need by the practitioner reporting on the
MD&A for an understanding of the business and the entity's accounting and
financial reporting practices for such prior period, as discussed in paragraph
.07, is not diminished and the practitioner should apply the appropriate pro-
cedures. In applying the appropriate procedures, the practitioner may consider
reviewing the predecessor auditor's working papers with respect to audits of
financial statements and examinations or reviews of MD&A presentations for
such prior periods.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .100 </b>Information that may be obtained from the audit or attest working
papers of the predecessor auditor will not provide a sufficient basis in itself for
the practitioner to express an opinion with respect to the MD&A disclosures for
such prior periods. If the practitioner has audited the current year, the results
of such audit may be considered in planning and performing the examination of MD&A and may provide evidential matter that is useful in performing the
examination, including with respect to matters disclosed for prior periods. For
example, an increase in salaries expense may be the result of an acquisition in
the last half of the prior year. Auditing procedures applied to payroll expense
in the current year that validate the increase as a result of the acquisition may
provide evidential matter with respect to the increase in salaries expense in
the prior year attributed to the acquisition.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .101 </b>In addition to the procedures described in paragraphs .49–.66, the
practitioner will need to make inquiries of the predecessor auditor and man-
agement as to audit adjustments proposed by the predecessor auditor that were
not recorded in the financial statements.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communications Between Predecessor and Successor Auditors</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .102 </b>If the practitioner is appointed as the successor auditor, he or she
follows the guidance AU-C section 210,
Terms of Engagement
,inconsidering
whether or not to accept the engagement. If, at the time of the appointment
as auditor, the practitioner is also being engaged to examine or review MD&A,
the practitioner should also make specific inquiries of the predecessor audi-
tor regarding MD&A. [Revised, December 2012, to reflect conforming changes
necessary due to the issuance of SAS Nos. 122–126.]</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .103 </b>The practitioner's examination may be facilitated by (
a
) making spe-
cific inquiries of the predecessor regarding matters that the successor believes
may affect the conduct of the examination (or review), such as areas that re-
quired an inordinate amount of time or problems that arose from the condi-
tion of the records, and (
b
) if the predecessor previously examined or reviewed
MD&A, reviewing the predecessor's working papers for the predecessor's ex-
amination or review engagement.</div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .104 </b>If, subsequent to his or her engagement to audit the financial state-
ments, the practitioner is requested to examine MD&A, the practitioner should
request the client to authorize the predecessor auditor to allow a review of the
predecessor's audit working papers related to the financial statement periods
included in the MD&A presentation. Although the practitioner may previously
have had access to the predecessor auditor's working papers in connection with
the successor's audit of the financial statements, ordinarily the predecessor au-
ditor should permit the practitioner to review those audit working papers re-
lating to matters that are disclosed or that would likely be disclosed in MD&A.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another Auditor Audits a Significant Part of the
Financial Statements</b></div>
<div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .105 </b>When one or more component auditors audits a significant part of a
group's financial statements, the practitioner
27
may request that the compo-
nent auditor perform procedures with respect to the MD&A or the practitioner
may perform the procedures directly with respect to such component(s).
<p>Unless the component auditor issues an examination or review report on a
separate MD&A presentation of such component(s) (see paragraph .74), the
practitioner examining the group's MD&A should not make reference to the
work of the component practitioner on MD&A in his or her report on MD&A
29
Accordingly, if the practitioner examining the group's MD&A has requested
such component auditor to perform procedures, the practitioner examining the
group's MD&A should perform those procedures that he or she considers nec-
essary to take responsibility for the work of the other auditor. Such procedures
may include one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>Visiting the component  auditor and discussing the procedures
followed and the results thereof.</li>
	<li>Reviewing the working papers of the component auditor with re-
spect to the component.</li>
	<li>Participating in discussions with the component's management
regarding matters that may affect the preparation of the compo-
nent's MD&A.</li>
	<li>Making supplemental tests with respect to such component.</li>
</ol>
<p>The determination of the extent of the procedures to be applied by the practi-
tioner examining the group's MD&A rests with that practitioner alone in the
exercise of his or her professional judgment and in no way constitutes a reflec-
tion on the adequacy of the component auditor's work. Because the practitioner
examining the group's MD&A in this case assumes responsibility for his or her
opinion on the MD&A presentation without making reference to the procedures
performed by the other auditor, the judgment of the practitioner examining the
group's MD&A should govern as to the extent of procedures to be undertaken.

MD&A presentation on file with the SEC (or other regulatory agency) has not
been revised for a matter for which the practitioner has or would qualify his or
her opinion, the practitioner should discuss such matter with the audit commit-

The specific written rep-

	<ol type="a">
		<li>Management's acknowledgment of its responsibility for the
preparation of MD&A and management's assertion that the MD&A presentation has been prepared in accordance with the
rules and regulations adopted by the SEC for MD&A</li>

statements</li>
		<li>Management's belief that the underlying information, determina-
tions, estimates, and assumptions of the entity provide a reason-
able basis for the disclosures contained in the MD&A</li>
		<li>A statement that management has made available all significant
documentation related to compliance with SEC rules and regula-
tions for MD&A</li>
		<li>Completeness and availability of all minutes of meetings of stock-
holders, directors, and committees of directors</li>
		<li>For a public entity, whether any communications from the SEC
were received concerning noncompliance with or deficiencies in
MD&A reporting practices</li>
		<li>Whether any events occurred subsequent to the latest balance-
sheet date that would require disclosure in the MD&A</li>
		<li>If forward-looking information is included, a statement that—</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The forward-looking information is based on manage-
ment's best estimate of expected events and operations,
and is consistent with budgets, forecasts, or operating
plans prepared for such periods</li>
			<li>The accounting principles expected to be used for the
forward-looking information are consistent with the prin-
ciples used in preparing the historical financial state-

gets, forecasts, or operating plans, and has informed the
practitioner of any anticipated changes or modifications
to such information that could affect the disclosures con-
tained in the MD&A presentation</li>

		<li>If voluntary information is included that is subject to the rules
and regulations adopted by the SEC (for example, information
required by Item 305,
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures

			<li>Management is responsible for the assumptions used in
determining the pro forma adjustments</li>
			<li>Management believes that the assumptions provide a rea-

However, based on the nature of the representations not obtained or the circum-
stances of the refusal, the practitioner may conclude that a qualified opinion is
appropriate in an examination engagement. In a review engagement, manage-
ment's refusal to furnish written representations constitutes a limitation of the
scope of the engagement sufficient to require withdrawal from the review en-

<p>We conducted our review of Management's Discussion and Analysis in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants. A review of Management's Discussion and Analysis
consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of
persons responsible for financial, accounting, and operational matters. It is substantially
less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is the expression
of an opinion on the presentation. Accordingly, we do not express such
an opinion.</p>
<p>The preparation of Management's Discussion and Analysis requires management
to interpret the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information
to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
information. Management's Discussion and Analysis includes information
regarding the estimated future impact of transactions and events that have
occurred or are expected to occur, expected sources of liquidity and capital resources,
operating trends, commitments, and uncertainties. Actual results in
the future may differ materially from management's present assessment of this
information because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected.</p>
<p>Based on our review, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe
that the Company's presentation of Management's Discussion and Analysis does not include, in all material respects, the required elements of the rules and
regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, that the historical
financial amounts included therein have not been accurately derived, in
all material respects, from the Company's financial statements, or that the underlying
information, determinations, estimates and assumptions of the Company
do not provide a reasonable basis for the disclosures contained therein.</p>

	<p>We have examined XYZ Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis
taken as a whole for the three-year period ended December 31, 20X5, included
[incorporated by reference] in the Company's [insert description of registration

Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the annual presentation based on our examination.
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, the financial statements of XYZ Company
as of December 31, 20X5 and 20X4, and for each of the years in the threeyear
period ended December 31, 19X5, and in our report dated [Month] XX,
20X6, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.</p>
<p>Our examination of Management's Discussion and Analysis was conducted in
accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the historical amounts and disclosures in the presentation.
An examination also includes assessing the significant determinations
made by management as to the relevancy of information to be included and the
estimates and assumptions that affect reported information. We believe that
our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>

resources, operating trends, commitments, and uncertainties. Actual results
in the future may differ materially from management's present assessment of
this information because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as
expected.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the Company's presentation of Management's Discussion and
Analysis for the three-year period ended December 31, 20X5, includes, in all
material respects, the required elements of the rules and regulations adopted
by the Securities and Exchange Commission; the historical financial amounts
included therein have been accurately derived, in all material respects, from
the Company's financial statements; and the underlying information, determinations,
estimates, and assumptions of the Company provide a reasonable basis
for the disclosures contained therein.</p>

taken as a whole for the six-month period ended June 30, 20X6 included
