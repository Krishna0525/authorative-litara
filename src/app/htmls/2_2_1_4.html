</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Other Presentation Matters Section provides guidance on other presentation matters not addressed in the Recognition, Initial Measurement, Subsequent Measurement, and Derecognition Sections. Other presentation matters may include items such as current or long-term balance sheet classification, cash flow presentation, earnings per share matters, and so forth. The FASB Codification also contains Presentation Topics, which provide guidance for general presentation and display items. See those Topics for general guidance.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Form and Content</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-1</b> A statement of cash flows shall report the cash effects during a period of an entity's operations, its investing transactions, and its financing transactions.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-2</b> A reconciliation of net income and net cash flow from operating activities, which generally provides information about the net effects of operating transactions and other events that affect net income and operating cash flows in different periods, also shall be provided.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-3</b> Financial statements shall not report an amount of cash flow per share. Neither cash flow nor any component of it is an alternative to net income as an indicator of an entity's performance, as reporting per-share amounts might imply. Reporting a contractually determined per-unit amount, such as a per unit amount of cash flow distributable under the terms of a partnership agreement or other agreement between an entity and its owners, is not the same as reporting a cash flow per-share amount intended to provide information useful to all investors and creditors and thus is not precluded by this Subtopic.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt; Cash and Cash Equivalents </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4</b>  A statement of cash flows shall explain the change during the period in cash and cash equivalents. The statement shall use descriptive terms such as cash or cash and cash equivalents rather than ambiguous terms such as funds. The total amounts of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the period shown in the statement of cash flows shall be the same amounts as similarly titled line items or subtotals shown in the statements of financial position as of those dates. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-5</b>  Cash purchases and sales of items commonly considered to be cash equivalents generally are part of the entity's cash management activities rather than part of its operating, investing, and financing activities, and details of those transactions need not be reported in a statement of cash flows.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-6</b>  Not all investments that qualify are required to be treated as cash equivalents. An entity shall establish a policy concerning which short-term, highly liquid investments that satisfy the definition of cash equivalents are treated as cash equivalents. For example, an entity having banking operations might decide that all investments that qualify except for those purchased for its trading account will be treated as cash equivalents, while an entity whose operations consist largely of investing in short-term, highly liquid investments might decide that all those items will be treated as investments rather than cash equivalents.
