<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au70501">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibility to issue an appropriate report in circumstances when, in forming an opinion in accordance with section 700, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forming an Opinion and Reporting on Financial Statements</i>, the auditor concludes that a modification to the auditor's opinion on the financial statements is necessary.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Form and Content of the Auditor's Report When the Opinion Is Modified</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<i>Basis for Modification Paragraph</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a20">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A20  </b>Consistency in the auditor's report helps promote users' understanding and identify unusual circumstances when they occur. Accordingly, although uniformity in the wording of a modified opinion and the description of the basis for the modification may not be possible, consistency in both the form and content of the auditor's report is desirable.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a21">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A21  </b>An example of the financial effects of material misstatements that the auditor may describe in the basis for modification paragraph in the auditor's report is the quantification of the effects on income before taxes, income taxes, net income, and equity if inventory is overstated. If such disclosures are made in a note to the financial statements, the basis for modification paragraph may be shortened by referring to it.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a22">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A22  </b>Adequate disclosures relate to the form, arrangement, and content of the financial statements and their related notes, including, for example, the terminology used, the amount of detail given, the classification of items in the statements, and the bases of amounts set forth. An auditor considers the disclosure of a particular matter in light of the circumstances and facts of which the auditor is aware at the time.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a23">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A23  </b>In considering the adequacy of disclosure, and in other aspects of the audit, the auditor uses information received in confidence from management. Without such confidence, the auditor would find it difficult to obtain information necessary to form an opinion on the financial statements. Rule 301, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Confidential Client Information</i> (ET sec. 301 par. .01), of the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct states that the auditor should not disclose any confidential client information without the specific consent of the client. Accordingly, the auditor may not make available, without management's consent, information that is not required to be disclosed in the financial statements to comply with the applicable financial reporting framework.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a24">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A24  </b>Practicable, as used in the context of paragraphs .18 and .20c, means that the information is reasonably obtainable from management's accounts and records and that providing the information in the report does not require the auditor to assume the position of a preparer of financial information. For example, the auditor would not be expected to prepare a basic financial statement or segment information and include it in the auditor's report when management omits such information.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a25">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A25  </b>Disclosing the omitted information in the basis for modification paragraph would not be practicable if

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.  </i>the information has not been prepared by management or the information is otherwise not readily available to the auditor or
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.  </i>in the auditor's professional judgment, the information would be unduly voluminous in relation to the auditor's report.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a26">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A26  </b>When the auditor modifies the opinion due to an inability to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence, it is not appropriate for the scope of the audit to be explained in a note to the financial statements because the description of the audit scope is the responsibility of the auditor and not that of management.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a27">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A27  </b>An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion relating to a specific matter described in the basis for qualification paragraph does not justify the omission of a description of other identified matters that would have otherwise required a modification of the auditor's opinion. In such cases, the disclosure of such other matters of which the auditor is aware may be relevant to users of the financial statements.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<i>Opinion Paragraph</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a28">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A28  </b>Inclusion of the paragraph heading required by paragraph .23 makes it clear to the user that the auditor's opinion is modified and indicates the type of modification.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a29">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A29  </b>When the auditor expresses a qualified opinion, it would not be appropriate to use phrases such as <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">with the foregoing explanation</i> or <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">subject to</i> in the opinion paragraph because these are not sufficiently clear or forceful. Because accompanying notes are part of the financial statements, wording such as "fairly presented, in all material respects, when read in conjunction with note 1" is likely to be misunderstood and would also not be appropriate.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au705a30">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A30  </b>When the auditor expresses a qualified opinion due to a scope limitation, paragraph .24 requires that the auditor state in the opinion paragraph that the qualification pertains to the possible effects of the matter on the financial statements and not to the scope limitation itself. Wording such as "In our opinion, except for the above-mentioned limitation on the scope of our audit ..." bases the exception on the restriction itself rather than on the possible effects on the financial statements and, therefore, is unacceptable.

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup> Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

If the Company stated inventories at the lower of cost or market, a write down of $XXX and $XXX would have been required as of December 31, 20X1 and 20X0, respectively. Accordingly, cost of sales would have been increased by $XXX and $XXX, and net income, income taxes, and stockholders' equity would have been reduced by $XXX, $XXX, and $XXX, and $XXX, $XXX, and $XXX, as of and for the years ended December 31, 20X1 and 20X0, respectively.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">As described in Note X, the Company has not consolidated the financial statements of subsidiary XYZ Company that it acquired during 20X1 because it has not yet been able to ascertain the fair values of certain of the subsidiary's material assets and liabilities at the acquisition date. This investment is therefore accounted for on a cost basis by the Company. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the subsidiary should have been consolidated because it is controlled by the Company.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup> Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence about the carrying amount of ABC Company's investment in XYZ Company as of December 31, 20X1 and ABC Company's share of XYZ Company's net income for the year then ended because we were denied access to the financial information, management, and the auditors of XYZ Company.

</b>  This section has been codified using an "AU-C" identifier instead of an "AU" identifier. "AU-C" is a temporary identifier to avoid confusion with references to existing "AU" sections, which will remain in AICPA Professional Standards through 2013. The "AU-C" identifier will revert to "AU" in 2014, by which time substantially all engagements for which the "AU" sections were still effective are expected to be completed.
