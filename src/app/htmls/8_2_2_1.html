<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Recognition Section provides guidance on the required criteria, timing, and location (within the financial statements) for recording a particular item in the financial statements. Disclosure is not recognition.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-20-25-1   </b>This Section sets forth criteria that must be met for designated hedging instruments and hedged items or <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">transactions</b> to qualify for <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fair value hedge</b> accounting, <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">cash flow hedge</b> accounting, and accounting for a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The criteria are organized as follows: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Formal designation and documentation at hedge inception 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Eligibility of hedged items and transactions 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Eligibility of hedging instruments 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Hedge effectiveness. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-20-25-2   </b>The guidance in this Section specifies whether a criterion applies to one or more types of hedging relationships. For example, paragraph 815-20-25-3(a)(1) is specified as a criterion that applies to fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, and net investment hedges.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Formal Designation and Documentation at Hedge Inception</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-20-25-3   </b>Concurrent designation and documentation of a hedge is critical; without it, an entity could retroactively identify a hedged item, a hedged <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">transaction</b>, or a method of measuring effectiveness to achieve a desired accounting result. To qualify for hedge accounting, there shall be, at inception of the hedge, formal documentation of all of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  [Subparagraph not used] 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Documentation requirement applicable to fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, and net investment hedges: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1.  The hedging relationship 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2.  The entity's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, including identification of all of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">i.  The hedging instrument. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">ii.  The hedged item or transaction. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">iii.  The nature of the risk being hedged. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">iv.  The method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fair value</b> (if a fair value hedge) or hedged transaction's variability in cash flows (if a cash flow hedge) attributable to the hedged risk. There shall be a reasonable basis for how the entity plans to assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">v.  The method that will be used to measure hedge ineffectiveness (including those situations in which the change in fair value method as described in paragraphs 815-30-35-31 through 35-32 will be used). 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">vi.  If the entity is hedging foreign currency risk on an after-tax basis, that the assessment of effectiveness, including the calculation of ineffectiveness, will be on an after-tax basis (rather than on a pretax basis). 
</p>
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Documentation requirement applicable to fair value hedges only: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1.  For a fair value hedge of a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">firm commitment</b>, a reasonable method for recognizing in earnings the asset or liability representing the gain or loss on the hedged firm commitment. 
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Documentation requirement applicable to cash flow hedges only: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1.  For a cash flow hedge of a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">forecasted transaction</b>, documentation shall include all relevant details, including all of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">i.  The date on or period within which the forecasted transaction is expected to occur. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">ii.  The specific nature of asset or liability involved (if any). 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">iii.  Either of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">01.  The expected currency amount for hedges of foreign currency exchange risk; that is, specification of the exact amount of foreign currency being hedged 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">02.  The quantity of the forecasted transaction for hedges of other risks; that is, specification of the physical quantity (that is, the number of items or units of measure) encompassed by the hedged forecasted transaction. 
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">iv.  If a forecasted sale or purchase is being hedged for price risk, the hedged transaction shall not be specified in either of the following ways: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">01.  Solely in terms of expected currency amounts 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">02.  As a percentage of sales or purchases during a period. 
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">v.  The current price of a forecasted transaction shall be identified to satisfy the criterion in paragraph 815-20-25-75(b) for offsetting cash flows. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">vi.  The hedged forecasted transaction shall be described with sufficient specificity so that when a transaction occurs, it is clear whether that transaction is or is not the hedged transaction. Thus, a forecasted transaction could be identified as the sale of either the first 15,000 units of a specific product sold during a specified 3-month period or the first 5,000 units of a specific product sold in each of 3 specific months, but it could not be identified as the sale of the last 15,000 units of that product sold during a 3-month period (because the last 15,000 units cannot be identified when they occur, but only when the period has ended).
