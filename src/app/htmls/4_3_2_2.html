</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Derecognition Section provides guidance on determining whether and when an entity should remove an item from the financial statements. For example, the entity would derecognize an asset because it no longer has rights to the asset or it would derecognize a liability because it no longer has any obligation.

<p class="header">&gt;  Beneficial Conversion Features</p>
</p><p id="47040">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-1</b>  For instruments with beneficial conversion features all of the unamortized discount remaining at the date of conversion shall be recognized immediately at that date as interest expense or as a dividend, a appropriate, including both of the following amounts:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The discount originated by the beneficial conversion option accounting under paragraph 470-20-25-5
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The discount from an allocation of proceeds under this Subtopic to other separable instruments included in the transaction.</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-2</b>  If convertible debt instrument containing an embedded beneficial conversion feature is converted, and the amount of discount amortized exceeds the amount the holder realized because conversion occurred at an earlier date, no adjustment shall be made to amounts previously amortized.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-3</b>  If a convertible debt instrument containing an embedded beneficial conversion feature is extinguished before conversion, the amount of the reacquisition price to be allocated to the repurchased beneficial conversion feature shall be measured using intrinsic value of that conversion feature at the extinguishment date.  The residual amount, if any, would be allocated to the convertible security.  Thus, the issuer shall record a gain or loss on extinguishment of the convertible debt security.  For guidance on classification of any gain or loss from extinguishment, see Section 47-50-45.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Conversion Features that Are Not Beneficial</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-4</b>  If a convertible debt instrument does not include a beneficial conversion feature, the carrying amount of the debt, including any unamortized premium or discount, shall be credited to the capital accounts upon conversion to reflect the stock issued and no gain or loss is recognized.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-4A</b>  The guidance in paragraphs 470-20-40-5 through 40-10 does not apply to debt instruments that are within the scope of the Cash Conversion Subsections of Subtopic 470-20.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Conversion Upon Issuer's Exercise of Call Option</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-5</b>  The following guidance addresses accounting for the issuance of equity securities to settle a debt instrument (pursuant to the instrument's original conversion terms) that become convertible upon the issuer's exercise of a call option:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Substantive conversion feature.  If the debt instrument contained a substantive conversion feature as of its issuance date, the issuance of equity securities shall be accounted for as a conversion.  that is, no gain or loss shall be recognized related to the equity securities issued to settle the instrument.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  No substantive conversion feature.  If the debt instrument did not contain a substantive conversion feature as of its issuance date (as defined in paragraphs 470-20-30-9 through 30-12), the issuance of equity securities shall be accounted for as a debt extinguishment.  That is, the fair value of the equity securities issued should be considered a component of the reacquisition price of the debt.
</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-6</b>  The assessment of whether the conversion feature is substantive may be performed after the issuance date but shall be based only on assumptions, considerations, and marketplace information available as if the issuance date.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt;  Determining Whether a Conversion Feature Is Substantive</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-7</b>  By definition, a substantive conversion feature is at least reasonably possible of being exercised in the future.  If the conversion price of an instrument at issuance is extremely high so that conversion of the instrument is not deemed at least reasonably possible as of its issuance date, then the conversion feature would not be considered substantive.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-8</b>  For purposes of determining whether a conversion feature is reasonably possible of being exercised, the assessment of the holder's intent is not necessary. Therefore, even if such an instrument included a conversion feature that provided for conversion due solely to the passage of time (for example, the instrument will become convertible at a date before its maturity date), it would be inappropriate to conclude that the conversion feature is substantive.  Also, an instrument that became convertible only upon the issuer's exercise of its call option does not possess a substantive conversion feature.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-9</b>  Methods that may be helpful in assessing whether a conversion feature is substantive include the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The fair value of the conversion feature relative to the fair value of the debt instrument.  Comparing the fair value of a conversion feature to the fair value of the debt instrument (that is, the complete instrument as issued) may provide evidence that the conversion feature is substantive.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The effective annual interest rate per the terms of the debt instrument relative to the estimated effective annual rate of a nonconvertible debt instrument with an equivalent expected term and credit risk.  Comparing the effective annual interest rate of the debt instrument to the effective annual rate the issuer estimates it could obtain on a similar nonconvertible instrument may provide evidence that a conversion feature is substantive.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  The fair value of the debt instrument relative to an instrument that is identical except for which the conversion option is not contingent.  Comparing the fair value of the debt instrument to the fair value of an identical instrument for which conversion is not contingent isolates the effect of the contingencies and may provide evidence about the substance of a conversion feature.  If the fair value of the debt instrument is similar to the fair value of an identical convertible debt instrument for which conversion is not contingent, then it may indicate that the conversion feature is substantive.  However, this approach may not be appropriate unless it is clear that the conversion feature, not considering the contingencies, is substantive.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Qualitative evaluation of the conversion provisions.  The nature of the conditions under which the instrument may become convertible may provide evidence that the conversion feature is substantive.  For example, if an instrument may become convertible upon the occurrence of a specified contingent event, the likelihood that he contingent event will occur before the instrument's maturity date may indicate that the conversion feature is substantive.  However, this approach may not be appropriate unless it is clear that the conversion feature,not considering the contingencies, is substantive.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-10</b>  The guidance in paragraphs 470-20-40-7 through 40-9 does not address the treatment of an instrument for purposes of applying Subtopic 260-10.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Interest Forfeiture</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-11</b>  If the terms of conversion of a convertible debt instrument provide that any accrued but unpaid interest at the date of conversion is forfeited by the former debt holder, accrued interest from the last interest payment date, if applicable, to the date of conversion, net of related income tax effects, if any, shall be charged to interest expense and credited to capital as part of the cost of securities issued. Thus, the accrued interest is accounted for in the same way as the principal amount of the debt converted and any unamortized issue premium or discount; the net carrying amount of the debt, including any unamortized premium or discount and the related accrual for interest to the date of conversion, net of any related income tax effects, is a credit to the entity's capital.

</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Recognition of Expense Upon Conversion</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-13</b>  The guidance in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-40-16</u> applies to conversions of convertible debt to equity securities pursuant to terms that reflect changes made by the debtor to the conversion privileges provided in the terms of the debt at issuance (including changes that involve the payment of consideration) for the purpose of inducing conversion. That guidance applies only to conversions that both:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Occur pursuant to changed conversion privileges that are exercisable only for a limited period of time (inducements offered without a restrictive time limit on their exercisability are not, by their structure, changes made to induce prompt conversion)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. Include the issuance of all of the equity securities issuable pursuant to conversion privileges included in the terms of the debt at issuance for each debt instrument that is converted, regardless of the party that initiates the offer or whether the offer relates to all debt holders.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-14</b>  A conversion includes an exchange of a convertible debt instrument for equity securities or a combination of equity securities and other consideration, whether or not the exchange involves legal exercise of the contractual conversion privileges included in terms of the debt. The preceding paragraph also includes conversions pursuant to amended or altered conversion privileges on such instruments, even though they are literally provided in the terms of the debt at issuance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-15</b>  The changed terms may involve any of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. A reduction of the original conversion price thereby resulting in the issuance of additional
shares of stock
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. An issuance of warrants or other securities not provided for in the original conversion terms
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. A payment of cash or other consideration to those debt holders that convert during the specified
time period.
</p>
</p><p>The guidance in the following paragraph does not apply to conversions pursuant to other changes in conversion privileges or to changes in terms of convertible debt instruments that are different from those described in this paragraph.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-16</b>  If a convertible debt instrument is converted to equity securities of the debtor pursuant to an inducement offer (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-40-13</u>), the debtor shall recognize an expense equal to the fair value of all securities and other consideration transferred in the transaction in excess of the fair value of securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms. The fair value of the securities or other consideration shall be measured as of the date the inducement offer is accepted by the convertible debt holder. That date normally will be the date the debt holder converts the convertible debt into equity securities or enters into a binding agreement to do so. Until the debt holder accepts the offer, no exchange has been made between the debtor and the debt holder. Example 1 (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-55-1</u>) illustrates the application of this guidance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-17</b>  The guidance in the preceding paragraph does not require recognition of gain or loss with respect to the shares issuable pursuant to the original conversion privileges of the convertible debt when additional securities or assets are transferred to a debt holder to induce prompt conversion of the debt to equity securities. In a conversion pursuant to original conversion terms, debt is extinguished in exchange for equity pursuant to a preexisting contract that is already recognized in the financial statements, and no gain or loss is recognized upon conversion.

<p class="header">Cash Conversion</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-19</b>  If an instrument within the scope of the Cash Conversion Subsections is derecognized, an issuer shall allocate the consideration transferred and transaction costs incurred to the extinguishment of the liability component and the reacquisition of the equity component.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-20</b>  Regardless of the form of consideration transferred at settlement, which may include cash (or other assets), equity shares, or any combination thereof, that allocation shall be performed as follows:


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Measure the fair value of the consideration transferred to the holder.  If the transaction is a modification or exchange that results in derecognition of the original instrument, measure the new instrument at fair value (including both the liability and equity components if the new instrument is also within the scope of the Cash Conversion Subsections)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. Allocate the fair value of the consideration transferred to the holder between the liability and equity components of the original instrument as follows: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1.  Allocate a portion of the settlement consideration to the extinguishment of the liability component equal to the fair value of that component immediately before extinguishment.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2.  Recognize in the statement of financial performance as a gain or loss on debt extinguishment any difference between (i) and (ii):

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">i.  The consideration attributed to the liability component.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">ii. the sum of both of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">01.  The net carrying amount of the liability component.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">02.  Any unamortized debt issuance costs.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">3.  Allocate the remaining settlement consideration to the reacquisition of the equity component and recognize that amount as a reduction of stockholder's equity.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-21</b>  If the derecognition transaction includes other unstated (or stated) rights or privileges in addition to the settlement of the convertible debt instrument, a portion of the settlement consideration shall be attributed to those rights and privileges base on the guidance in other applicable U.S. GAAP.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40-22</b>  Transaction costs incurred with third parties other than the investor(s) that directly relate to the settlement of a convertible debt instrument within the scope of the Cash Conversion Subsections shall be allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of consideration transferred at settlement and accounted for as debt extinguishment costs and equity reacquisition costs, respectively.
