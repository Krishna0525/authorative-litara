<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15  Scope</b>
</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">842-10-15-1  </b>An entity shall apply this Topic to all <b>leases</b>, including <b>subleases</b>. Because a lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an identified
asset) to any of the following:
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.</b>Leases of intangible assets (see Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.</b>Leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas, and similar nonregenerative resources (see Topics 930, Extractive Activities— Mining, and 932, Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas). This includes the intangible right to explore for those natural resources and rights to use the land in which those natural resources are contained (that is, unless those rights of use include more than the right to explore for natural resources), but not equipment used to explore for the natural resources.
</p><p id="8403030">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">c.   </b>Leases of biological assets, including timber (see Topic 905, Agriculture).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d.   </b>Leases of <b>inventory</b> (see Topic 330, Inventory).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">e.   </b>Leases of assets under construction (see Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment).
</p><!-- <p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-4   </b>Example 1 (paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">840-30-55-1</u>) illustrates a lessee's accounting for a capital lease, including the lessee's initial measurement of a capital lease asset and obligation.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Identifying a Lease </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">842-10-15-2   </b>At inception of a <b>contract</b>, an entity shall determine whether that
contract is or contains a <b>lease</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">842-10-15-3 </b> A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A period of time may be described in terms of the amount of use of an identified asset (for example, the number of production units that an item of equipment will be used to produce).
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">842-10-15-4 </b> To determine whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset (see paragraphs 842-10-15-17 through 15-26) for a period of time, an entity shall assess whether, throughout the <b>period of use</b>, the customer has both of the following:
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.   </b>The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset (see paragraphs 842-10-15-17 through 15-19)
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.   </b>The right to direct the use of the identified asset (see paragraphs 842-10- 15-20 through 15-26).
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.   </b>If the customer in the contract is a joint operation or a joint arrangement, an entity shall consider whether the joint operation or joint arrangement has the right to control the use of an identified asset throughout the period of use.
</p>


<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">842-10-15-5   </b>If the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for only a portion of the term of the contract, the contract contains a lease for that portion of the term.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">842-10-15-6  </b>An entity shall reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease only if the terms and conditions of the contract are changed.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A842-10-15-7</b> In making the determination about whether a contract is or contains a lease, an entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">842-10-15-8</b>  Paragraph 842-10-55-1 includes a flowchart that depicts the decision process for evaluating whether a contract is or contains a lease.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Identified Asset</b>

</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">842-10-15-9</b> An asset typically is identified by being explicitly specified in a contract. However, an asset also can be identified by being implicitly specified at the time that the asset is made available for use by the customer.
