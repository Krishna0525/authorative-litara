<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc55001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibilities relating to related party relationships and transactions in an audit of financial statements. Specifically, it expands on how section 315, Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement; section 330, Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained; and section 240, Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit, are to be applied regarding risks of material misstatement associated with related party relationships and transactions.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc55002">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>Section 700, Forming an Opinion and Reporting on Financial Statements, requires the auditor to evaluate whether the financial statements achieve fair presentation.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 1</sup> Section 800, Special Considerations—Audits of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance With Special Purpose Frameworks, requires that, in audits of special purpose financial statements that contain related party transactions, the auditor evaluate whether the financial statements include informative disclosures similar to those required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup> Section 800 also requires the auditor to evaluate whether additional disclosures beyond those specifically required by the framework and related to matters that are not specifically identified on the face of the financial statements or other disclosures may be necessary for the financial statements to achieve fair presentation.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 3</sup> Thus, this section applies to all audits of financial statements.
</div>

</div>




<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nature of Related Party Relationships and Transactions (Ref: par. .A1–.A6)</b>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc55003">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03 </b>Many related party transactions are in the normal course of business. In such circumstances, they may carry no higher risk of material misstatement of the financial statements than similar transactions with unrelated parties.  However, the nature of related party relationships and transactions may, in some circumstances, give rise to higher risks of material misstatement of the financial statements than transactions with unrelated parties. For example

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>related parties may operate through an extensive and complex range of relationships and structures, with a corresponding increase in the complexity of related party transactions.</li>

<li>information systems may be ineffective at identifying or summarizing transactions and outstanding balances between an entity and its related parties.</li>

<li>related party transactions may not be conducted under normal market terms and conditions (for example, some related party transactionsmay be conducted with no exchange of consideration).</li>

<li>related party transactions may be motivated solely or in large measure to engage in fraudulent financial reporting or conceal misappropriation of assets.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responsibilities of the Auditor</b>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc55004">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04 </b>Because related parties are not independent of each other, financial reporting frameworks establish specific accounting and disclosure requirements for related party relationships, transactions, and balances to enable users of the financial statements to understand their nature and actual or potential effects on the financial statements. Therefore, the auditor has a responsibility to perform audit procedures to identify, assess, and respond to the risks of material misstatement arising from the entity's failure to appropriately account for or disclose related party relationships, transactions, or balances. (Ref: par. .A3) </div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc55005">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05 </b>In addition, an understanding of the entity's related party relationships and transactions is relevant to the auditor's evaluation of whether one or more fraud risk factors are present, as required by section 240, because fraud may be more easily committed through related parties.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sup>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc55006">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06 </b>Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, an unavoidable risk exists that some material misstatements of the financial statements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS).<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5</sup> In the context of related parties, the potential effects of inherent limitations on the auditor's ability to detect material misstatements are greater because of reasons such as the following:

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>Management may be unaware of the existence of all related party relationships and transactions.</li>

<li>Related party relationships may present a greater opportunity for collusion, concealment, or manipulation by management.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc55007">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07 </b>Planning and performing the audit with professional skepticism as required by section 200, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance With Generally Accepted Auditing Standards</i>, is, therefore, particularly important in this context, given the potential for undisclosed related party relationships and transactions.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6</sup> The requirements in this section are designed to assist the auditor in identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement associated with related party relationships and transactions and in designing audit procedures to respond to the assessed risks.
