<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>Scope of This Section</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>.01 This section provides general principles for engagements performed in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARSs) issued by the Accounting and Review Services Committee (ARSC) and codified into AR-C sections. This section also sets forth the meaning of certain terms used in SSARSs when describing the professional requirements imposed on accountants performing a review, compilation, or an engagement to prepare financial statements.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>.02 This section is intended to help accountants better understand their professional responsibilities when performing an engagement in accordance with SSARSs. Additional sections have been established to set forth specific performance and reporting requirements. Such additional requirements are based on the general principles provided by this section, and any requirements created by this section also have been incorporated into the additional sections.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>.03 SSARSs are written in the context of a review, compilation, or an engagement to prepare financial statements by an accountant. They are to be adapted as necessary in the circumstances when applied to reviews, compilations, and engagements to prepare other historical or prospective financial information. SSARSs do not address the responsibilities of the accountant that may exist in legislation, regulation, or otherwise. Such responsibilities may differ from those established in SSARSs. Accordingly, although the accountant may find aspects of SSARSs helpful in such circumstances, it is the responsibility of the accountant to ensure compliance with all relevant legal, regulatory, or professional obligations.
Effective Date</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>.04 This section is effective for engagements performed in accordance with SSARSs for periods ending on or after December 15, 2015. Early implementation is permitted.
