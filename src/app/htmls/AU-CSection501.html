</div><div id="auc50102">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02 </b>This section is effective for audits of financial statements for periods ending on or after December 15, 2012.
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objective</b>
</div><div id="auc50103">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03 </b>The objective of the auditor is to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">a. valuation of investments in securities and derivative instruments;
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">b. existence and condition of inventory;
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">c. completeness of litigation, claims, and assessments involving the entity; and
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">d. presentation and disclosure of segment information, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.
</div>
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Litigation, Claims, and Assessments</b>
</div><div id="auc50116">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16 </b>The auditor should design and perform audit procedures to identify litigation, claims, and assessments involving the entity that may give rise to a risk of material misstatement, including (Ref: par. .A39–.A45)

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">a. inquiring of management and, when applicable, others within the entity, including in-house legal counsel;
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">b. obtaining from management a description and evaluation of litigation, claims, and assessments that existed at the date of the financial statements being reported on and during the period from the date of the financial statements to the date the information is furnished, including an identification of those matters referred to legal counsel;<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3</sup>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">c. reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance; documents obtained from management concerning litigation, claims, and assessments; and correspondence between the entity and its external legal counsel; and
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">d. reviewing legal expense accounts and invoices from external legal counsel.
</div>
</div><div id="auc50117">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.17 </b>For actual or potential litigation, claims, and assessments identified based on the audit procedures required in paragraph .16, the auditor should obtain audit evidence relevant to the following factors:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">a. The period in which the underlying cause for legal action occurred
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">b. The degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">c. The amount or range of potential loss
</div>
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<i>Communication With the Entity's Legal Counsel</i>
</b>
</div><div id="auc50118">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.18 </b>Unless the audit procedures required by paragraph .16 indicate that no actual or potential litigation, claims, or assessments that may give rise to a risk of material misstatement exist, the auditor should, in addition to the procedures required by other AU-C sections, seek direct communication with the entity's external legal counsel. The auditor should do so through a letter of inquiry prepared by management and sent by the auditor requesting the entity's external legal counsel to communicate directly with the auditor. (Ref: par. .A40 and .A46–.A63)
</div><div id="auc50119">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.19 </b>In addition to the direct communications with the entity's external legal counsel referred to in paragraph .18, the auditor should, in cases when the entity's in-house legal counsel has the responsibility for the entity's litigation, claims, and assessments, seek direct communication with the entity's in-house legal counsel through a letter of inquiry similar to the letter referred to in paragraph .18. Audit evidence obtained from in-house legal counsel in this manner is not, however, a substitute for the auditor seeking direct communication with the entity's external legal counsel, as described in paragraph .18. (Ref: par. .A64)
</div><div id="auc50120">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.20 </b>The auditor should document the basis for any determination not to seek direct communication with the entity's legal counsel, as required by paragraphs .18–.19.
</div><div id="auc50121">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.21 </b>The auditor should request management to authorize the entity's legal counsel to discuss applicable matters with the auditor.
</div><div id="auc50122">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.22 </b>As described in paragraphs .18–.19, the auditor should request, through letter(s) of inquiry, the entity's legal counsel to inform the auditor of any litigation, claims, assessments, and unasserted claims that the counsel is aware of, together with an assessment of the outcome of the litigation, claims, and assessments, and an estimate of the financial implications, including costs involved. Each letter of inquiry should include, but not be limited to, the following matters: (Ref: par. .A69)

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Identification of the entity, including subsidiaries, and the date of the audit
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">b. A list prepared by management (or a request by management that the legal counsel prepare a list) that describes and evaluates pending or threatened litigation, claims, and assessments with respect to which the legal counsel has been engaged and to which the legal counsel has devoted substantive attention on behalf of the company in the form of legal consultation or representation
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">c. A list prepared by management that describes and evaluates unasserted claims and assessments that management considers to be probable of assertion and that, if asserted, would have at least a reasonable possibility of an unfavorable outcome with respect to which the legal counsel has been engaged and to which the legal counsel has devoted substantive attention on behalf of the entity in the form of legal consultation or representation
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">d. Regarding each matter listed in item b, a request that the legal counsel either provide the following information or comment on those matters on which the legal counsel's views may differ from those stated by management, as appropriate:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">i. A description of the nature of the matter, the progress of the case to date, and the action that the entity intends to take (for example, to contest the matter vigorously or to seek an out-of-court settlement)
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">ii. An evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and an estimate, if one can be made, of the amount or range of potential loss (Ref: par. .A65)
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">iii. With respect to a list prepared by management (or by the legal counsel at management's request), an identification of the omission of any pending or threatened litigation, claims, and assessments or a statement that the list of such matters is complete
</div>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">e. Regarding each matter listed in item c, a request that the legal counsel comment on those matters on which the legal counsel's views concerning the description or evaluation of the matter may differ from those stated by management
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">f. A statement that management understands that whenever, in the course of performing legal services for the entity with respect to a matter recognized to involve an unasserted possible claim or assessment that may call for financial statement disclosure, the legal counsel has formed a professional conclusion that the entity should disclose or consider disclosure concerning such possible claim or assessment, the legal counsel, as a matter of professional responsibility to the entity, will so advise the entity and will consult with the entity concerning the question of such disclosure and the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework (for example, the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board [FASB] <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accounting Standards Codification</i> [ASC] 450, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contingencies</i>)
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">g. A request that the legal counsel confirm whether the understanding described in item <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">f</i> is correct</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">h. A request that the legal counsel specifically identify the nature of, and reasons for, any limitation on the response
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">i. A request that the legal counsel specify the effective date of the response
</div>
</div><div id="auc50123">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.23 </b>When the auditor is aware that an entity has changed legal counsel or that the legal counsel previously engaged by the entity has resigned, the auditor should consider making inquiries of management or others about the reasons such legal counsel is no longer associated with the entity. (Ref: par. .A55)
</div><div id="auc50124">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.24 </b>The auditor should modify the opinion in the auditor's report, in accordance with section 705, if (Ref: par. .A56–.A65)

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">a. the entity's legal counsel refuses to respond appropriately to the letter of inquiry and the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence by performing alternative audit procedures or
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">b. management refuses to give the auditor permission to communicate or meet with the entity's external legal counsel.
</div>
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Segment Information</b>
</div><div id="auc50125">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.25 </b>The auditor should obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the presentation and disclosure of segment information, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework, by (Ref: par. .A66–.A67)

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">a. obtaining an understanding of the methods used by management in determining  segment information and (Ref: par. .A68)

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">i. evaluating whether such methods are likely to result in 

disclosure in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">ii. when appropriate, testing the application of such methods and
</div>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">b. performing analytical procedures or other audit procedures appropriate in the circumstances.

<i>Attendance at Physical Inventory Counting (Ref: par. .11a)</i>
</b>
</div><div id="auc501a20">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A20 </b>Management ordinarily establishes procedures under which inventory is physically counted at least once per year to serve as a basis for the preparation of the financial statements and, if applicable, to ascertain the reliability of the entity's perpetual inventory system.</div><div id="auc501a21">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A21 </b>Attendance at physical inventory counting involves

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>inspecting the inventory to ascertain its existence and evaluate its condition and performing test counts,</li>

<li>observing compliance with management's instructions and the performance of procedures for recording and controlling the results of the physical inventory count, and</li>

<li>obtaining audit evidence about the reliability of management's count procedures.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>These procedures may serve as tests of controls or substantive procedures, or both, depending on the auditor's risk assessment, planned approach, and the specific procedures carried out.
</div><div id="auc501a22">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A22 </b>Matters relevant in planning attendance at physical inventory counting (or in designing and performing audit procedures pursuant to paragraphs .11–.15) include, for example, the following:

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>The risks of material misstatement related to inventory.</li>

<li>The control risk related to inventory.</li>

<li>Whether adequate procedures are expected to be established and proper instructions issued for physical inventory counting.</li>

<li>The timing of physical inventory counting.</li>

<li>Whether the entity maintains a perpetual inventory system.</li>

<li>The locations at which inventory is held, including the materiality of the inventory and the risks of material misstatement at different locations, in deciding at which locations attendance is appropriate. Section 600 addresses the involvement of component auditors and, accordingly, may be relevant if such involvement is with regard to attendance of physical inventory counting at a remote location.</li>

<li>Whether the assistance of an auditor's specialist is needed. Section 620, <i>Using theWork of an Auditor's Specialist</i>, addresses the use of an auditor's specialist to assist the auditor in obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluate Management's Instructions and Procedures (Ref: par. .11a(i))</i>
</div><div id="auc501a23">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A23 </b>Matters relevant in evaluating management's instructions and procedures for recording and controlling the physical inventory counting include whether they address, for example, the following:

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>The application of appropriate control activities (for example, the collection of used physical inventory count records, accounting for unused physical inventory count records, and count and recount procedures)</li>

<li>The accurate identification of the stage of completion of work in progress; slow moving, obsolete, or damaged items; and inventory owned by a third party (for example, on consignment)</li>

<li>The procedures used to estimate physical quantities, when applicable, such as may be needed in estimating the physical quantity of a coal pile</li>

<li>Control over the movement of inventory between areas and the shipping and receipt of inventory before and after the cutoff date</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observe the Performance of Management's Count Procedures (Ref: par. .11a(ii))</i>
</div><div id="auc501a24">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A24 </b>Observing the performance of management's count procedures (for example, those relating to control over the movement of inventory before, during, and after the count) assists the auditor in obtaining audit evidence that management's instructions and count procedures are designed and implemented adequately. In addition, the auditor may obtain copies of cutoff information, such as details of the movement of inventory, to assist the auditor in performing audit procedures over the accounting for such movements at a later date.
</div><div>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inspect the Inventory (Ref: par. .11a(iii))</i>
</div><div id="auc501a25">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A25 </b>Inspecting inventory when attending physical inventory counting assists the auditor in ascertaining the existence of the inventory (though not necessarily its ownership) and in identifying obsolete, damaged, or aging inventory.
</div><div>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perform Test Counts (Ref: par. .11a(iv))</i>
</div><div id="auc501a26">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A26 </b>Performing test counts (for example, by tracing items selected from management's count records to the physical inventory and tracing items selected from the physical inventory to management's count records) provides audit evidence about the completeness and accuracy of those records.
</div><div id="auc501a27">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A27 </b>In addition to recording the auditor's test counts, obtaining copies of management's completed physical inventory count records assists the auditor in performing subsequent audit procedures to determine whether the entity's final inventory records accurately reflect actual inventory count results.
</div><div>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Use of Management's Specialists</i>
</div><div id="auc501a28">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A28 </b>Management may engage specialists who have expertise in the taking of physical inventories to count, list, price, and subsequently compute the total dollar amount of inventory on hand at the date of the physical count. For example, entities such as retail stores, hospitals, and automobile dealers may use specialists in this manner.
</div><div id="auc501a29">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A29 </b>An inventory count performed by an external inventory firm engaged as a management specialist does not, by itself, provide the auditor with sufficient appropriate audit evidence. The auditor is required by section 500 to perform certain procedures if information to be used as audit evidence has been prepared using the work of a management's specialist.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7</sup> The auditor may, for example, examine the specialist's program, observe its procedures and controls, make or observe some physical counts of the inventory, recompute calculations of the submitted inventory on a test basis, and apply appropriate tests to the intervening transactions.
</div><div id="auc501a30">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A30 </b>Although the auditor may adjust the extent of the work on the physical count of inventory because of the work of management's specialist, any restriction imposed on the auditor such that the auditor is unable to perform the procedures that the auditor considers necessary is a scope limitation. In such cases, section 705 requires the auditor to modify the opinion in the auditor's report as a result of the scope limitation.
