<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at70108">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08  </b>The objective of a review of MD&amp;A is to report whether any information came to the practitioner's attention to cause him or her to believe that -

</p>

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial, accounting, and operational matters. A review ordinarily does not contemplate (a) tests of accounting records through inspection, observation, or confirmation, (b) obtaining corroborating evidential matter in response to inquiries, or (c) the application of certain other procedures ordinarily performed during an examination of MD&amp;A. A review may bring to the practitioner's attention significant matters affecting the MD&amp;A, but it does not provide assurance that the practitioner will become aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09  </b>A practitioner may accept an engagement to review the MD&amp;A presentation of a public entity for an annual period provided the practitioner has audited, in accordance with GAAS, the financial statements for at least the latest annual period to which the MD&amp;A presentation relates and the financial statements for the other periods covered by the MD&amp;A presentation have been audited by the practitioner or a predecessor auditor.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 14</sup>  A base knowledge of the entity and its operations gained through an audit of the historical financial statements and knowledge about the industry and the environment is necessary to provide the practitioner with sufficient knowledge to properly evaluate the results of the procedures performed in connection with the review.

The annual financial statements for the periods covered by the MD&amp;A presentation have been or will be audited and the practitioner has audited or will audit the most recent year (refer to paragraph .07 if the financial statements for prior years were audited by a predecessor auditor).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    Management will provide a written assertion that the presentation has been prepared using the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC as the criteria. (See paragraph .02.)

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">(1)    A review of the historical financial statements for the related interim periods under the Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARSs) and issues a review report thereon
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">(2)    A review of the condensed interim financial information for the related interim periods under AU section 722  and issues a review report thereon, and such interim financial information is accompanied by complete annual financial statements for the most recent fiscal year that have been audited
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">(3)    An audit of the interim financial statements
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    The MD&amp;A presentation for the most recent fiscal year has been or will be examined or reviewed.

<p class="header">Engagement Acceptance Considerations</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at70115">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.15  </b>In determining whether to accept an engagement, the practitioner should consider whether management (and others engaged by management to assist them, such as legal counsel) has the appropriate knowledge of the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC to prepare MD&amp;A.
</p>

</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Responsibilities of Management</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at70116">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16  </b>Management is responsible for the preparation of the entity's MD&amp;A pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. The preparation of MD&amp;A in conformity with the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC requires management to interpret the criteria, accurately derive the historical amounts from the entity's books and records, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported information.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.17  </b>An entity should not name the practitioner in a client-prepared document as having examined or reviewed MD&amp;A unless the MD&amp;A presentation and related practitioner's report and the related financial statements and auditor's (or accountant's review) report are included in the document (or, in the case of a public entity, incorporated by reference to such information filed with a regulatory agency). If such a statement is made in a document that does not include (or incorporate by reference) such information, the practitioner should request that neither his or her name nor reference to the practitioner be made with respect to the MD&amp;A information, or that such document be revised to include the required presentations and reports. If the client does not comply, the practitioner should advise the client that he or she does not consent to either the use of his or her name or the reference to the practitioner, and he or she should consider what other actions might be appropriate.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 15</sup>
</p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Obtaining an Understanding of the SEC Rules and Regulations and Management's Methodology for the Preparation of MD&amp;Amp;A</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at70118">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.18  </b>The practitioner should obtain an understanding of the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC for MD&amp;A. (Refer to paragraph .04.)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.19  </b>The practitioner should inquire of management regarding the method of preparing MD&amp;A, including matters such as the sources of the information, how the information is gathered, how management evaluates the types of factors having a material effect on financial condition (including liquidity and capital resources), results of operations, and cash flows, and whether there have been any changes in the procedures from the prior year.
</p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Timing of Procedures</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at70120">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.20  </b>Proper planning by the practitioner contributes to the effectiveness of the attest procedures in an examination or a review of MD&amp;A. Performing some of the work in conjunction with the audit of the historical financial statements or the review of interim financial statements may permit the work to be carried out in a more efficient manner and to be completed at an earlier date. When performing an examination or a review of MD&amp;A, the practitioner may consider the results of tests of controls, analytical procedures,<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 16</sup> and substantive tests performed in a financial statement audit or analytical procedures and inquiries made in a review of financial statements or interim financial information.
</p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Materiality</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at70121">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.21  </b>The practitioner should consider the concept of materiality in planning and performing the engagement. The objective of an examination or a review is to report on the MD&amp;A presentation taken as a whole and not on the individual amounts and disclosures contained therein. In the context of an MD&amp;A presentation, the concept of materiality encompasses both material omissions (for example, the omission of trends, events, and uncertainties that are currently known to management that are reasonably likely to have material effects on the entity's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources) and material misstatements in MD&amp;A, both of which are referred to herein as a misstatement. Assessing the significance of a misstatement of some items in MD&amp;A may be more dependent upon qualitative than quantitative considerations. Qualitative aspects of materiality relate to the relevance and reliability of the information presented (for example, qualitative aspects of materiality are considered in assessing whether the underlying information, determinations, estimates, and assumptions of the entity provide a reasonable basis for the disclosures in the MD&amp;A). Furthermore, quantitative information is often more meaningful when accompanied by qualitative disclosures. For example, quantitative information about market risk-sensitive instruments is more meaningful when accompanied by qualitative information about an entity's market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed. Materiality is also a concept that is judged in light of the expected range of reasonableness of the information; therefore, users should not expect prospective information (information about events that have not yet occurred) to be as precise as historical information.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.22  </b>In expressing an opinion, or providing the limited assurance of a review engagement, on the presentation, the practitioner should consider the omission or misstatement of an individual assertion (see paragraph .34) to be material if the magnitude of the omission or misstatement - individually or when aggregated with other omissions or misstatements - is such that a reasonable person using the MD&amp;A presentation would be influenced by the inclusion or correction of the individual assertion. The relative rather than absolute size of an omission or misstatement may determine whether it is material in a given situation.
</p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Inclusion of Pro Forma Financial Information</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at70123">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.23  </b>Management may include pro forma financial information with respect to a business combination or other transactions in MD&amp;A. The practitioner should consider the guidance in section 401, Reporting on Pro Forma Financial Information, paragraph .10, when performing procedures with respect to such information, even if management indicates in MD&amp;A that certain information has been derived from unaudited financial statements. For example, in an examination of MD&amp;A, the practitioner's procedures would ordinarily include obtaining an understanding of the underlying transaction or event, discussing with management their assumptions, obtaining sufficient evidence in support of the adjustments, and other procedures for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the MD&amp;A presentation taken as a whole and not for expressing an opinion on (or providing the limited assurance of a review of) the pro forma financial information included therein under section 401.

</b>  The SEC staff from time to time issues guidance related to the SEC's adopted requirements; for example, Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs), Staff Legal Bulletins, and speeches. Although such guidance may provide additional information with respect to the adopted requirements for MD&amp;A, the practitioner should not be expected to attest to assertions on compliance with such guidance. The practitioner may find it helpful to also familiarize himself or herself with material contained on the SEC's website www.sec.gov that provides further information with respect to the SEC's views concerning MD&amp;A disclosures.

</b>  Restrictions on the scope of the audit of the financial statements will not necessarily preclude the practitioner from accepting an engagement to examine MD&amp;A. Note that the SEC will generally not accept an auditor's report that is modified for a scope limitation. The practitioner should consider the nature and magnitude of the scope limitation and the form of the auditor's report in assessing whether an examination of MD&amp;A could be performed.

</b>  As discussed in paragraph .85k, a review report is not intended to be filed with the SEC as a report under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and, accordingly, the review report should contain a statement of restrictions on the use of the report to specified parties if the entity is (a) a public entity or (b) a nonpublic entity that is making or has made an offering of securities and it appears that the securities may subsequently be registered or subject to a filing with the SEC or other regulatory agency.

</b>  AU section 329, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analytical Procedures</i>, defines analytical procedures as "evaluations of financial information made by a study of plausible relationships among both financial and nonfinancial data. Analytical procedures range from simple comparisons to the use of complex models involving many relationships and elements of data." In applying analytical procedures to MD&amp;A, the practitioner develops expectations of matters that would be discussed in MD&amp;A by identifying and using plausible relationships that are reasonably expected to exist based on the practitioner's understanding of the client and of the industry in which the client operates, and the knowledge of relationships among the various financial elements gained through the audit of financial statements or review of interim financial information. Refer to AU section 329 for further discussion of analytical procedures.
