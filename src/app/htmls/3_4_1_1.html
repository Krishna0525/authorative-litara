</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Subsequent Measurement Section provides guidance on an entity's subsequent measurement and subsequent recognition of an item.  Situations that may result in subsequent changes to the carrying amount include impairment, fair value adjustments, depreciation and amortization, and so forth.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt; Determining the Implied Fair Value of Goodwill</b> 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-14</b>  The implied fair value of goodwill shall be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination or an acquisition by a not-for-profit entity was determined. That is, an entity shall assign the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination or an acquisition by a not-for-profit entity.  Throughout this Section, the term <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">business combination</i> includes an <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">acquisition by a not-for-profit entity.</i>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-15</b>  The relevant guidance in Subtopic 805-20 shall be used in determining how to assign the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit.  Including in that allocation would be research and development assets that meet the criteria in paragraph 350-20-35-39.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-16</b>  The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-17</b>  That assignment process discussed in paragraphs 350-20-35-14 through 35-16 shall be performed only for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment; an entity shall not write up or write down a recognized asset or liability, nor shall it recognize a previously unrecognized intangible asset as a result of that allocation process.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-18</b>  If the second step of the goodwill impairment test is not complete before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25) and a goodwill impairment loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, the best estimate of that loss shall be recognized in those financial statements (see Subtopic 450-10).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-19</b> Paragraph 350-20-50-2(c) requires disclosure of the fact that the measurement of the impairment loss is an estimate.  Any adjustment to that estimated loss base don the completion of the measurement of the impairment loss shall be recognized in the subsequent reporting period.
 </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Deferred Tax Considerations</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-20</b>  For purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill, an entity shall use the income tax bases of a reporting unit's assets and liabilities implicit in the tax structure assumed in its estimation of fair value of the reporting unit in Step 1.  That is, an entity shall use its existing income tax bases if the assumed structure used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit was a nontaxable transaction, and it shall use new income tax bases if the assumed structure was a taxable transaction.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-21</b>  Paragraph 805-740-25-6 indicates that a deferred tax liability or asset shall be recognized for differences between the assigned values and the income tax bases of the recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination in accordance with paragraph 805-740-25-3.  To the extent present, tax attributes that will be consistent with the guidance contained in paragraph 805-740-30-3.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;</b>  Determining the Fair Value of a Reporting Unit
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-22</b>  The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  However, the market price of an individual equity security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-23</b>  Substantial value may arise from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over another entity.  Consequently, measuring the fair value of a collection of assets and liabilities that operate together in a controlled entity is different from measuring the fair value of that entity's individual equity securities.  An acquiring entity often is willing to pay more foe equity securities that give it a controlling interest than an investor would pay for a number of equity securities representing less than a controlling interest.  that control premium may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to exceed its market capitalization.  The quoted market price of an individual security, therefore, need not be the sole measurement basis of the fair value of a reporting unit.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-24</b>  In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, a valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue or a similar performance measure may be used if that technique is consistent with the objective of measuring fair value.  Use of multiples of earnings or revenue in determining the fair value of a reporting unit may be appropriate, for example, when the fair value of an entity that has comparable operations and economic characteristics is observable and the relevant multiples of the comparable entity are known.  Conversely, use of multiples would not be appropriate in situations in which the operations or activities of an entity for which the multiples are known are not of a comparable nature, scope, or size as the reporting unit for which fair value is being estimated.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt;  Deferred Income Tax Considerations</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-25</b>  Before estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, an entity shall determine whether that estimation should be based on an assumption that the unit could be bought or sold in a nontaxable transaction or a taxable transaction.  Making that determination is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances and must be evaluated carefully on a case-by-case basis (see Examples 1 through 2 [paragraphs 350-20-55-10 trough 55-23]).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-26</b>  In making that determination, an entity shall consider all of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Whether the assumption is consistent with those that marketplace participants would incorporate into their estimates of fair value.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  the feasibility of the assumed structure.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  whether the assumed structure results in the highest economic value to the seller for the reporting unit, including consideration of related tax implications.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-27</b>  In determining the feasibility of a nontaxable transaction, an entity shall consider, among other factors, both of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Whether the reporting unit could be sold in a nontaxable transaction.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Whether there are nay income tax laws and regulations or other corporate governance requirements that could limit an entity's ability to treat a sale of the unit as a nontaxable transaction.
