</p><p id="26010">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-1</b>  This section, which is an integral part of the requirements of this Subtopic, provides general guidance to be used in the computation of earnings per share (EPS).
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt;  Computing a Weighted-Average</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-2</b>  The weighted-average number of shares is an arithmetical mean average of shares outstanding and assumed to be outstanding for EPS computations.  The most precise average would be the sum of the shares determined on a daily basis divided by the number of days in the period.  Less-precise averaging methods may be used, however, as long as they produce reasonable results.  Methods that introduce artificial weighting, such as the Rule of 78 method, are not acceptable for computing a weighted-average number of shares for EPS computations.

<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt;   Year-to-Date Computations</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-3</b>  The number of incremental shares included in quarterly diluted EPS shall be computed using the average market prices during the three months included in the reporting period.  For year-to-date diluted EPS, the number of incremental shares to be included in the denominator shall be determined by computing a year-to-date weighted average of the number of incremental shares included in each quarterly EPS computation.  Example 1 (see paragraph 260-10-55-38) provides an illustration of that provision.</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;&gt;&gt;  Average Market Price</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-4</b>  In applying the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">treasury stock method</b>, the average market price of <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">common stock</b> shall represent a meaningful average. Theoretically, every market transaction for an entity's common stock could be included in determining the average market price. As a practical matter, however, a simple average of weekly or monthly prices usually will be adequate.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-5</b>  Generally, closing market prices are adequate for use in computing the average market price.  When prices fluctuate widely, however, an average of the high and low prices for the period that the price represents usually would produce a more representative price. The method used to compute the average market price shall be used consistently unless it is no longer representative because of changed conditions. For example, an entity that uses closing market prices to compute the average market price for several years of relatively stable market prices might need to change to an average of high and low prices if prices start fluctuating greatly and the closing market prices no longer produce a representative average market price.

<p class="header">&gt;&gt;&gt;  Options and Warrants and Their Equivalents</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-6</b>  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Options</b> or warrants to purchase convertible securities shall be assumed to be exercised to purchase the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">convertible security</b> whenever the average prices of both the convertible <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">security</b> and the common stock obtainable upon conversion are above the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">exercise price</b> of the options or warrants. However, exercise shall not be assumed unless conversion of similar outstanding convertible securities, if any, also is assumed. The treasury stock method shall be applied to determine the incremental number of convertible securities that are assumed to be issued and immediately converted into common stock. Interest or dividends shall not be imputed for the incremental convertible securities because any imputed amount would be reversed by the if-converted adjustments for assumed conversions.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-7</b>  Paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">260-10-55-9 through 55-11</u> provide guidance on how certain options, warrants, and convertible securities should be included in the computation of diluted EPS. Conversion or exercise of the potential common shares discussed in those paragraphs shall not be reflected in diluted EPS unless the effect is dilutive. Those potential common shares will have a dilutive effect if either of the following conditions is met:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. The average market price of the related common stock for the period exceeds the exercise price.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. The security to be tendered is selling at a price below that at which it may be tendered under the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">option</b> or <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">warrant</b> agreement and the resulting discount is sufficient to establish an effective exercise price below the market price of the common stock obtainable upon exercise.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-8</b>  When several conversion alternatives exist, the computation shall give effect to the alternative that is most advantageous to the holder of the convertible security. Similar treatment shall be given to <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">preferred stock</b> that has similar provisions or to other securities that have conversion options that permit the investor to pay cash for a more favorable <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">conversion rate</b>.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-9</b>  Options or warrants may permit or require the tendering of debt or other securities of the issuer (or its parent or its <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">subsidiary</b>) in payment of all or a portion of the exercise price. In computing diluted EPS, those options or warrants shall be assumed to be exercised and the debt or other securities shall be assumed to be tendered. If tendering cash would be more advantageous to the option holder or warrant holder and the contract permits tendering cash, the treasury stock method shall be applied. Interest (net of tax) on any debt assumed to be tendered shall be added back as an adjustment to the numerator. The numerator also shall be adjusted for any nondiscretionary adjustments based on income (net of tax). The treasury stock method shall be applied for proceeds assumed to be received in cash.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-10</b>  The underlying terms of certain options or warrants may require that the proceeds received from the exercise of those securities be applied to retire debt or other securities of the issuer (or its parent or its subsidiary). In computing diluted EPS, those options or warrants shall be assumed to be exercised and the proceeds applied to purchase the debt at its average market price rather than to purchase common stock under the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method shall be applied, however, for excess proceeds received from the assumed exercise. Interest, net of tax, on any debt assumed to be purchased shall be added back as an adjustment to the numerator. The numerator also shall be adjusted for any nondiscretionary adjustments based on income (net of tax).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-11</b>  Convertible securities that permit or require the payment of cash by the holder of the security at conversion are considered the equivalent of warrants. In computing diluted EPS, the proceeds assumed to be received shall be assumed to be applied to purchase common stock under the treasury stock method and the convertible security shall be assumed to be converted under the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">if-converted method</b>. See Example 11 (paragraph 260-10-55-78) for guidance on the effects of <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">contingently convertible instruments</b> on diluted EPS.

</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Stock Dividends or Stock Splits</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-12</b>  If the number of common shares outstanding increases as a result of a stock dividend or stock split (see Subtopic 505-20) or decreases as a result of a reverse stock split, the computations of basic and diluted EPS shall be adjusted retroactively for all periods presented to reflect that change in capital structure.  If changes in common stock resulting form stock dividends, stock splits, or reverse stock splits occur after the close of the period but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25), the per-share computations for those and any prior-period financial statements presented shall be based on the new number of shares.  If per-share computations reflect such changes in the number of shares, that fact shall be disclosed.</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Rights Issues</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-13</b>  A rights issue whose exercise price at issuance is less than the fair value of the stock contains a bonus element that is somewhat similar to a stock dividend.  If a rights issue contains a bonus element and the rights issue is offered to all existing stock holders, basic and diluted EPS shall be adjusted retroactively for the bonus element for all periods presented.  If the ability to exercise the rights issue is contingent on some event other than the passage of time, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable until that contingency is resolved.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-14</b>  The number of common shares used in computing basic and diluted EPS for all periods prior to the rights issue shall be the number of common shares outstanding immediately prior to the issue multiplied by the following factor: (fair value per share immediately prior to the exercise of the rights)/(theoretical ex-rights fair value per share).  Theoretical ex-rights fair value per share shall be computed by adding the aggregate fair value of the shares immediately prior to the exercise of the rights to the proceeds expected from the exercise of the rights and dividing by the number of shares outstanding after the exercise of the rights.  Example 5 (see paragraph 260-10-55-60) illustrates that provision.  If the rights themselves are to be publicly traded separately from the shares prior to the exercise date, fair value for the purposes of this computation shall be established at the close of the last day on which the shares are traded together with the rights.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Prior-Period Adjustments</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-15</b>  If authoritative literature requires that a restatement of the results of operations of a prior period be included in the income statement or summary of earnings, then EPS data given for the prior period or periods shall be restated.  The effect of restatement, expressed in per-share terms,  shall be disclosed in the period of restatement.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-16</b>  Restated EPS data shall be computed as if the restated income or loss had been reported originally in the prior period or periods.  Thus, it is possible that common stock assumed to be issued upon exercise, conversion, or issuance of potential common shares in accordance with the provisions of this Subtopic may not be included in the computation of restated EPS amounts.  That is, retroactive restatement of income from continuing operations could cause potential common shares originally determined to be dilutive to become antidilutive pursuant to the control number provision in paragraph 260-10-45-18.  The reverse is also true.  Retroactive restatement also may cause the numerator of the EPS computation to change by an amount that differs from the amount of the retroactive adjustment.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt;  Business Combinations and Reorganizations</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-17</b>  When common shares are issued to acquire a business combination, the computations of EPS shall recognize the existence of the new shares only from the acquisition date.  In reorganizations, EPS computations shall be based on analysis of the particular transaction and the provisions of this Subtopic.
