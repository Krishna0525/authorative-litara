<P class="p6 ft4">Introduction</P>
<P class="p7 ft5">Scope of This Section</P>
<P class="p8 ft7"><SPAN class="ft6">.01 </SPAN>This section applies when the accountant is engaged to perform a com- pilation of financial statements, prospective financial information, pro forma financial information, or other historical financial information. (Ref: par. .A1–</P>
<P class="p9 ft9">.A4).<SPAN class="ft8">[1] </SPAN>[As amended, effective for compilation reports on prospective financial information dated on or after May 1, 2017, by SSARS No. 23.]</P>
<P class="p10 ft5">The Compilation Engagement</P>
<P class="p11 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">.02 </SPAN>Because a compilation engagement is not an assurance engagement, a compilation engagement does not require the accountant to verify the accu- racy or completeness of the information provided by management or otherwise gather evidence to express an opinion or a conclusion on the financial state- ments.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Effective Date</P>
<P class="p11 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">.03 </SPAN>This section is effective for compilations of financial statements for pe- riods ending on or after December 15, 2015. Early implementation is permitted.</P>
<P class="p6 ft4">Objective</P>
<P class="p12 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">.04 </SPAN>The objective of the accountant in a compilation engagement is to ap- ply accounting and financial reporting expertise to assist management in the presentation of financial statements and report in accordance with this sec- tion without, undertaking to obtain or provide any assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements in order for them to be in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.</P>
<P class="p13 ft4">Deﬁnitions</P>
<P class="p12 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">.05 </SPAN>For purposes of Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARSs), the following terms have the meanings attributed as fol- lows:</P>

<P class="p16 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">Basic financial statements. </SPAN>Financial statements excluding supplemen- tary information and required supplementary information.</P>
<P class="p17 ft0">Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). <SPAN class="ft9">Reference to </SPAN><SPAN class="ft14">generally accepted accounting principles </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">in SSARSs means gener- ally accepted accounting principles promulgated by bodies desig- nated by the Council of the AICPA pursuant to the "Compliance With Standards Rule" (ET sec. 1.310.001) and the "Accounting Prin- ciples Rule" (ET sec. 1.320.001) of the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p18 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">Management. </SPAN>The person(s) with executive responsibility for the con- duct of the entity's operations. For some entities, management includes some or all of those charged with governance (for example, executive members of a governance board or an <NOBR>owner-manager).</NOBR></P>
<P class="p19 ft7"><SPAN class="ft6">Misstatement. </SPAN>A difference between the amount, classification, presenta- tion, or disclosure of a reported financial item and the amount, classi- fication, presentation, or disclosure that is required for the item to be presented fairly in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error.</P>
<P class="p20 ft7">Misstatements also include those adjustments of amounts, classifica- tions, presentations, or disclosures that, in the accountant's profes- sional judgment, are necessary for the financial statements to be pre- sented fairly, in all material respects.</P>
<P class="p21 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">Required supplementary information. </SPAN>Information that a designated accounting <NOBR>standards-setter</NOBR> requires to accompany an entity's basic financial statements. Required supplementary information is not part of the basic financial statements; however, a designated accounting <NOBR>standards-setter</NOBR> considers the information to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an ap- propriate operational, economic, or historical context. In addition, au- thoritative guidelines for the methods of measurement and presenta- tion of the information have been established.</P>
<P class="p22 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">Supplementary information. </SPAN>Information presented outside the basic financial statements, excluding required supplementary information, that is not considered necessary for the financial statements to be fairly presented in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. Such information may be presented in a document con- taining the financial statements subjected to the compilation engage- ment or separate from the financial statements subjected to the com- pilation engagement. (Ref: <NOBR>par. .A6–.A7)</NOBR></P>
<P class="p23 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">Those charged with governance. </SPAN>The person(s) or organization(s) (for example, a corporate trustee) with responsibility for overseeing the strategic direction of the entity and the obligations related to the ac- countability of the entity. This includes overseeing the financial report- ing process. Those charged with governance may include management personnel (for example, executive members of a governance board or an <NOBR>owner-manager).</NOBR></P>

<P class="p152 ft7"><SPAN class="ft6">.A8 </SPAN>The interpretations of the "Independence Rule" (ET sec. 1.200.001) of the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct provide authoritative guidance with respect to independence. It is in the public interest and, therefore, required by this section, that the accountant modify the accountant's compilation report when the accountant is not independent of the entity whose financial state- ments are the subject of the compilation engagement. The AICPA Code of Pro- fessional Conduct also defines <SPAN class="ft16">independence </SPAN>as consisting of two elements, in- dependence of mind and independence in appearance. Independence enhances the accountant's ability to act with integrity and be objective. Independence implies an impartiality that recognizes an obligation to be fair not only to man- agement but also to users of the financial statements, who may rely upon the accountant's compilation report. In the absence of an interpretation of the "In- dependence Rule" that addresses a particular relationship or circumstance, a member should apply the "Conceptual Framework for Independence" interpre- tation (ET sec. 1.210.010).

<P class="p153 ft21">Acceptance and Continuance of Client Relationships and Compilation Engagements (Ref: par. .08)</P>
<P class="p89 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">.A9 </SPAN>A compilation in accordance with SSARSs is conducted on the premise that management has acknowledged and understands that it has the respon- sibility set out in paragraph .26<SPAN class="ft14">b </SPAN>of section 60. The preparation of financial statements, in whole or in part, is a nonattest service subject to the provisions of the "Nonattest Services" subtopic of the "Independence Rule" (ET sec. 1.295).

<P class="p154 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">.A11 </SPAN>Both management and the accountant have an interest in document- ing the terms of the compilation engagement before the commencement of the engagement to help avoid misunderstandings with respect to the engagement. For example, it reduces the risk that management may inappropriately rely on or expect the accountant to protect management against certain risks or per- form certain functions, including those that are management's responsibility. [Paragraph renumbered by the issuance of SSARS No. 23, October 2016. Para- graph subsequently renumbered, October 2016, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SSARS No. 23.]</P>
<P class="p89 ft9"><SPAN class="ft0">.A12 </SPAN>The roles of management and those charged with governance in agreeing upon the terms of the compilation engagement for the entity depend on the governance structure of the entity and relevant law or regulation. De- pending on the entity's structure, the agreement may be with management, those charged with governance, or both. Nonetheless, when the agreement on the terms of engagement is only with those charged with governance, in accor- dance with paragraph .26<SPAN class="ft14">b </SPAN>of section 60, the accountant is required to obtain management's agreement that it acknowledges and understands its respon- sibilities.

<P class="p155 ft7"><SPAN class="ft6">.A13 </SPAN>When a third party has contracted for a compilation of the entity's financial statements, agreeing the terms of the compilation with management of the entity is necessary in order to establish that the preconditions for a com- pilation are present.

<P class="p110 ft26"><SPAN class="ft25">.A28 </SPAN>Circumstances may exist in which a regulatory or contractual basis of accounting is based on a general purpose framework established by a desig- nated accounting standard setter, such as GAAP, or by law or regulation, but does not comply with all the requirements of that framework. An example is a contract that requires financial statements to be prepared in accordance with most, but not all, of GAAP.

<P class="p166 ft9"><NOBR>.29–.33</NOBR> apply. [Paragraph added, effective for compilations of financial state- ments for periods ending on or after December 15, 2021, by SSARS No. 25.]</P>

In the example of the contract in paragraph .A28, the description of the applicable financial re- porting framework would refer to the financial reporting provisions of the con- tract. The requirement in paragraph .21 is designed to avoid misunderstand- ings about compliance with the general purpose framework.
