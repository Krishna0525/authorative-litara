<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc50002">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>This section is applicable to all the audit evidence obtained during the course of the audit. Other AU-C sections address

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>specific aspects of the audit (for example, section 315, <i>Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement</i>);</li>

<li>the audit evidence to be obtained regarding a particular topic (for example, section 570, <i>The Auditor's Consideration of an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern</i>); </li>

<li>specific procedures to obtain audit evidence (for example, section 520, <i>Analytical Procedures</i>); and</li>

<li>the evaluation of whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been obtained (for example, section 200, <i>Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance With Generally Accepted Auditing Standards</i>, and section 330, <i>Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained</i>).</li>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Information to Be Used as Audit Evidence</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<i>Relevance and Reliability</i>
</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a27">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A27  </b>As noted in paragraph .A1, although audit evidence is primarily obtained from audit procedures performed during the course of the audit, it also may include information obtained from other sources (for example, previous audits, in certain circumstances, and a firm's quality control procedures for client acceptance and continuance). The quality of all audit evidence is affected by the relevance and reliability of the information upon which it is based.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a28">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A28  </b>Relevance relates to the logical connection with, or bearing upon, the purpose of the audit procedure and, when appropriate, the assertion under consideration. The relevance of information to be used as audit evidence may be affected by the direction of testing. For example, if the purpose of an audit procedure is to test for overstatement in the existence or valuation of accounts payable, testing the recorded accounts payable may be a relevant audit procedure. On the other hand, when testing for understatement in the existence or valuation of accounts payable, testing the recorded accounts payable would not be relevant, but testing such information as subsequent disbursements, unpaid invoices, suppliers' statements, and unmatched receiving reports may be relevant.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a29">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A29  </b>A given set of audit procedures may provide audit evidence that is relevant to certain assertions but not others. For example, inspection of documents related to the collection of receivables after the period-end may provide audit evidence regarding existence and valuation but not necessarily cutoff. Similarly, obtaining audit evidence regarding a particular assertion (for example, the existence of inventory) is not a substitute for obtaining audit evidence regarding another assertion (for example, the valuation of that inventory). On the other hand, audit evidence from different sources or of a different nature may often be relevant to the same assertion.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a30">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A30  </b>Tests of controls are designed to evaluate the operating effectiveness of controls in preventing, or detecting and correcting, material misstatements at the assertion level. Designing tests of controls to obtain relevant audit evidence includes identifying conditions (characteristics or attributes) that indicate performance of a control and identifying deviation conditions that indicate departures from adequate performance. The presence or absence of those conditions can then be tested by the auditor.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a31">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A31  </b>Substantive procedures are designed to detect material misstatements at the assertion level. They comprise tests of details and substantive analytical procedures. Designing substantive procedures includes identifying conditions relevant to the purpose of the test that constitute a misstatement in the relevant assertion.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reliability</i>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a32">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A32  </b>The reliability of information to be used as audit evidence and, therefore, of the audit evidence itself is influenced by its source and nature and the circumstances under which it is obtained, including the controls over its preparation and maintenance, when relevant. Therefore, generalizations about the reliability of various kinds of audit evidence are subject to important exceptions. Even when information to be used as audit evidence is obtained from sources external to the entity, circumstances may exist that could affect its reliability. Information obtained from an independent external source may not be reliable, for example, if the source is not knowledgeable or a management specialist lacks objectivity. While recognizing that exceptions may exist, the following generalizations about the reliability of audit evidence may be useful:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>The reliability of audit evidence is increased when it is obtained from independent sources outside the entity.</li>

<li>The reliability of audit evidence that is generated internally is increased when the related controls, including those over its preparation and maintenance, imposed by the entity are effective.</li>

<li>Audit evidence obtained directly by the auditor (for example, observation of the application of a control) is more reliable than audit evidence obtained indirectly or by inference (for example, inquiry about the application of a control).</li>

<li>Audit evidence in documentary form, whether paper, electronic, or other medium, is more reliable than evidence obtained orally (for example, a contemporaneously written record of a meeting is more reliable than a subsequent oral representation of the matters discussed).</li>

<li>Audit evidence provided by original documents is more reliable than audit evidence provided by photocopies, facsimiles, or documents that have been filmed, digitized, or otherwise transformed into electronic form, the reliability of which may depend on the controls over their preparation and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a33">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A33  </b>Section 520 provides further guidance regarding the reliability of data used for purposes of designing analytical procedures as substantive procedures.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 10</sup>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a34">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A34 </b>Section 240, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit</i>, addresses circumstances in which the auditor has reason to believe that a document may not be authentic or may have been modified without that modification having been disclosed to the auditor.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 11</sup>

<i>Reliability of Information Produced by a Management's Specialist</i>
</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a35">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A35  </b>The preparation of an entity's financial statements may require expertise in a field other than accounting or auditing, such as actuarial calculations, valuations, or engineering data. The entity uses a management's specialist in these fields to obtain the needed expertise to prepare the financial statements. Failure to do so when such expertise is necessary increases the risks of material misstatement and may be a significant deficiency or material weakness.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 12</sup>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a36">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A36  </b>When information to be used as audit evidence has been prepared using the work of a management's specialist, the requirement in paragraph .08 applies. For example, an individual or organization may possess expertise in the application of models to estimate the fair value of securities for which no observable market exists. If the individual or organization applies that expertise in making an estimate which the entity uses in preparing its financial statements, the individual or organization is a management's specialist and paragraph .08 applies. If, on the other hand, that individual or organization merely provides price data regarding private transactions not otherwise available to the entity which the entity uses in its own estimation methods, such information, if used as audit evidence, is subject to paragraph .07, but it is not the use of a management's specialist by the entity.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a37">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A37  </b>The nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures with regard to the requirement in paragraph .08 may be affected by such matters as the following:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>The nature and complexity of the matter to which the management's specialist relates</li>

<li>The risks of material misstatement of the matter</li>

<li>The availability of alternative sources of audit evidence</li>

<li>The nature, scope, and objectives of the work of the management's specialist</li>

<li>Whether the management's specialist is employed by the entity or is a party engaged by it to provide relevant services</li>

<li>The extent to which management can exercise control or influence over the work of the management's specialist</li>

<li>Whether the management's specialist is subject to technical performance standards or other professional or industry requirements</li>

<li>The nature and extent of any controls within the entity over the work of the management's specialist</li>

<li>The auditor's knowledge and experience of the field of expertise management's specialist</li>

<li>The auditor's previous experience of the work of that specialist</li>
</ul>

<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Competence, Capabilities, and Objectivity of a Management's Specialist</i>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a38">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A38  </b>Competence relates to the nature and level of expertise of the management's specialist. Capability relates to the ability of the management's specialist to exercise that competence in the circumstances. Factors that influence capability may include, for example, geographic location and the availability of time and resources. Objectivity relates to the possible effects that bias, conflict of interest, or the influence of others may have on the professional or business judgment of the management's specialist. The competence, capabilities, and objectivity of a management's specialist, and any controls within the entity over that specialist's work, are important factors with regard to the reliability of any information produced by a management's specialist. 
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a39">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A39  </b>Information regarding the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of a management's specialist may come from a variety of sources, such as the following:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Personal experience with previous work of that specialist</li>

<li>Discussions with that specialist</li>

<li>Discussions with others who are familiar with that specialist's work</li>

<li>Knowledge of that specialist's qualifications, membership in a professional body or industry association, license to practice, or other forms of external recognition</li>

<li>Published papers or books written by that specialist</li>

<li>An auditor's specialist, if any, that assists the auditor in obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence with respect to information produced by the management's specialist</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a40">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A40  </b>Matters relevant to evaluating the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of a management's specialist include whether that specialist's work is subject to technical performance standards or other professional or industry requirements, for example, ethical standards and other membership requirements of a professional body or industry association, accreditation standards of a licensing body, or requirements imposed by law or regulation.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a41">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A41  </b>Other matters that may be relevant include

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>the relevance of the capabilities and competence of the management's specialist to the matter for which that specialist's work will be used, including any areas of specialty within that specialist's field. For example, a particular actuary may specialize in property and casualty insurance but have limited expertise regarding pension calculations.</li>

<li>the competence of the management's specialist with respect to relevant accounting requirements, for example, knowledge of assumptions and methods, including models, when applicable, that are consistent with the applicable financial reporting framework.</li>

<li>whether unexpected events, changes in conditions, or the audit evidence obtained from the results of audit procedures indicate that it may be necessary to reconsider the initial evaluation of the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of the management's specialist as the audit progresses.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a42">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A42  </b>A broad range of circumstances may threaten objectivity, for example, self-interest threats, advocacy threats, familiarity threats, self-review threats, and intimidation threats. Safeguards may reduce such threats and may be created either by external structures (for example, the profession, legislation, or regulation of the management's specialist) or by the work of the management's specialist environment (for example, quality control policies and procedures).
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a43">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A43  </b>Although safeguards cannot eliminate all threats to the objectivity of a management's specialist, threats such as intimidation threats may be of less significance to a specialist engaged by the entity than to a specialist employed by the entity, and the effectiveness of safeguards such as quality control policies and procedures may be greater. Because the threat to objectivity created by being an employee of the entity will always be present, a specialist employed by the entity cannot ordinarily be regarded as being more likely to be objective than other employees of the entity.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a44">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A44  </b>When evaluating the objectivity of a specialist engaged by the entity, it may be relevant to discuss with management and that specialist any interests and relationships that may create threats to the specialist's objectivity and any applicable safeguards, including any professional requirements that apply to the specialist, and to evaluate whether the safeguards are adequate. Interests and relationships creating threats may include the following:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Financial interests</li>

<li>Business and personal relationships</li>

<li>Provision of other services</li>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a45">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A45  </b>An understanding of the work of the management's specialist includes an understanding of the relevant field of expertise. An understanding of the relevant field of expertise may be obtained in conjunction with the auditor's determination of whether the auditor has the expertise to evaluate the work of the management's specialist, or whether the auditor needs an auditor's specialist for this purpose.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 13</sup>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a46">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A46  </b>Aspects of the field of the management's specialist relevant to the auditor's understanding may include
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>whether that specialist's field has areas of specialty within it that are relevant to the audit.</li>

<li>whether any professional or other standards and regulatory or legal requirements apply.</li>

<li>what assumptions and methods are used by the management's specialist and whether they are generally accepted within that specialist's field and appropriate for financial reporting purposes.</li>

<li>the nature of internal and external data or information the management's specialist uses.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc500a47">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A47  </b>In the case of a management's specialist engaged by the entity, there will ordinarily be an engagement letter or other written form of agreement between the entity and that specialist. Evaluating that agreement when obtaining an understanding of the work of the management's specialist may assist the auditor in determining for the auditor's purposes the appropriateness of 

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>the nature, scope, and objectives of that specialist's work;</li>

<li>the respective roles and responsibilities of management and that specialist; and</li>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A48  </b>In the case of a management's specialist employed by the entity, it is less likely that there will be a written agreement of this kind.
