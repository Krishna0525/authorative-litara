<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-1</b> An employee share purchase plan that satisfies all of the following criteria does not give rise to recognizable compensation cost (that is, the plan is non compensatory): 
<ol>
	<li> a. The plan satisfies either of the following conditions:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				1. The terms of the plan are no more favorable than those available to all holders of the same class of shares. Note that a transaction subject to an employee share purchase plan that involves a class of equity shares designed exclusively for and held only by current or former employees or their beneficiaries may be compensatory depending on the terms of the arrangement.
			</li>
			<li>
				2. Any purchase discount from the market price does not exceed the per-share amount of share issuance costs that would have been incurred to raise a significant amount of capital by a public offering. A purchase discount of 5 percent or less from the market price shall be considered to comply with this condition without further justification. A purchase discount greater than 5 percent that cannot be justified under this condition results in compensation cost for the entire amount of the discount. Note that an entity that justifies a purchase discount in excess of 5 percent shall reassess at least annually, and no later than the first share purchase offer during the fiscal year, whether it can continue to justify that discount pursuant to this paragraph.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		b. Substantially all employees that meet limited employment qualifications may participate on an equitable basis.
	</li>
	<li>
		c. The plan incorporates no option features, other than the following:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				1. Employees are permitted a short period of time—not exceeding 31 days—after the purchase price has been fixed to enroll in the plan.
			</li>
			<li>
				2. The purchase price is based solely on the market price of the shares at the date of purchase, and employees are permitted to cancel participation before the purchase date and obtain a refund of amounts previously paid (such as those paid by payroll withholdings).
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-2</b>  A plan provision that establishes the purchase price as an amount based on the lesser of the equity share’s market price at date of grant or its market price at date of purchase, commonly called a look-back plan, is an example of an option feature that causes the plan to be compensatory. Similarly, a plan in which the purchase price is based on the share’s market price at date of grant and that permits a participating employee to cancel participation before the purchase date and obtain a refund of amounts previously paid contains an option feature that causes the plan to be compensatory. Section718-50-55 provides guidance on determining whether an employee share purchase plan satisfies the criteria necessary to be considered non compensatory.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-3</b>The requisite service period for any compensation cost resulting from an employee share purchase plan is the period over which the employee participates in the plan and pays for the shares.
