<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibility to design and implement responses to the risks of material misstatement identified and assessed by the auditor in accordance with section 315, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement</i>, and to evaluate the audit evidence obtained in an audit of financial statements. Section 700, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forming an Opinion and Reporting on Financial Statements</i>, addresses the auditor's responsibility to form an opinion on the financial statements based on the evaluation of the audit evidence obtained.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<i>Substantive Procedures</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc33018">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.18  </b>Irrespective of the assessed risks of material misstatement, the auditor should design and perform substantive procedures for all relevant assertions related to each material class of transactions, account balance, and disclosure.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc33019">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.19  </b>The auditor should consider whether external confirmation procedures are to be performed as substantive audit procedures.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc33020">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.20  </b>The auditor should use external confirmation procedures for accounts receivable, except when one or more of the following is applicable: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.  </i>The overall account balance is immaterial.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.  </i>External confirmation procedures for accounts receivable would be ineffective.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">c.  </i>The auditor's assessed level of risk of material misstatement at the relevant assertion level is low, and the other planned substantive procedures address the assessed risk. In many situations, the use of external confirmation procedures for accounts receivable and the performance of other substantive procedures are necessary to reduce the assessed risk of material misstatement to an acceptably low level.

<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Substantive Procedures Related to the Financial Statement Closing Process</i>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc33021">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.21  </b>The auditor's substantive procedures should include audit procedures related to the financial statement closing process, such as

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.  </i>agreeing or reconciling the financial statements with the underlying accounting records and
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.  </i>examining material journal entries and other adjustments made during the course of preparing the financial statements
</p>
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Substantive Procedures Responsive to Significant Risks</i>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc33022">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.22  </b>If the auditor has determined that an assessed risk of material misstatement at the relevant assertion level is a significant risk, the auditor should perform substantive procedures that are specifically responsive to that risk. When the approach to a significant risk consists only of substantive procedures, those procedures should include tests of details.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of Substantive Procedures</i>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc33023">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.23  </b>If substantive procedures are performed at an interim date, the auditor should cover the remaining period by performing

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.  </i>substantive procedures, combined with tests of controls for the intervening period, or
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.  </i>if the auditor determines that it is sufficient, further substantive procedures only,
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">that provide a reasonable basis for extending the audit conclusions from the interim date to the period-end.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc33024">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.24  </b>If misstatements that the auditor did not expect when assessing the risks of material misstatement are detected at an interim date, the auditor should evaluate whether the related assessment of risk and the planned nature, timing, or extent of substantive procedures covering the remaining period need to be modified.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.25  </b>When designing tests of controls and tests of details, the auditor should determine the means of selecting items for testing that are effective in meeting the purpose of the audit procedure.
