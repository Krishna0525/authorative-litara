</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Other Presentation Matters Section provides guidance on other presentation matters not addressed in the Recognition, Initial Measurement, Subsequent Measurement, and Derecognition Sections. Other presentation matters may include items such as current or long-term balance sheet classification, cash flow presentation, earnings per share matters, and so forth. The FASB Codification also contains Presentation Topics, which provide guidance for general presentation and display items. See those Topics for general guidance.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Accounting Changes </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Change in Accounting Principle </b>
</p><p id="25045">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-1</b>  A presumption exists that an accounting principle once adopted shall not be changed in accounting for events and transactions of a similar type. Consistent use of the same accounting principle from one accounting period to another enhances the utility of financial statements for users by facilitating analysis and understanding of comparative accounting data. Neither of the following is considered to be a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">change in accounting principle:</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Initial adoption of an accounting principle in recognition of events or transactions occurring for the first time or that previously were immaterial in their effect
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Adoption or modification of an accounting principle necessitated by transactions or events that are clearly different in substance from those previously occurring.
</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-2</b>  A reporting entity shall change an accounting principle only if either of the following apply: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The change is required by a newly issued Codification update.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The entity can justify the use of an allowable alternative accounting principle on the basis that it is preferable.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-3</b>  It is expected that Codification updates normally will provide specific transition requirements. However, in the unusual instance that there are no transition requirements specific to a particular Codification update, a change in accounting principle effected to adopt the requirements of that Codification update shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">250-10-45-5 through 45-8</u>. Early adoption of a Codification update, when permitted, shall be effected in a manner consistent with the transition requirements of that update. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4</b>  This requirement is not limited to newly issued Codification updates. For example, if existing Codification guidance permits a choice between two or more alternative accounting principles, and provides requirements for changing from one to another, those requirements shall be followed. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-5</b>  An entity shall report a change in accounting principle through <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">retrospective application</b> of the new accounting principle to all prior periods, unless it is impracticable to do so. Retrospective application requires all of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The cumulative effect of the change to the new accounting principle on periods prior to those presented shall be reflected in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the first period presented.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  An offsetting adjustment, if any, shall be made to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position) for that period.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Financial statements for each individual prior period presented shall be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new accounting principle.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-6</b>  If the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods can be determined, but it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects of that change on all prior periods presented, the cumulative effect of the change to the new accounting principle shall be applied to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period to which the new accounting principle can be applied. An offsetting adjustment, if any, shall be made to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position) for that period.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-7</b>  If it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to any prior period, the new accounting principle shall be applied as if the change was made prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. See Example 1 (paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">250-10-55-3 through 55-11</u> for an illustration of a change from the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. That Example does not imply that such a change would be considered preferable as required by paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">250-10-45-12</u>. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-8</b>  Retrospective application shall include only the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">direct effects of a change in accounting principle</b>, including any related income tax effects. Indirect effects that would have been recognized if the newly adopted accounting principle had been followed in prior periods shall not be included in the retrospective application. If indirect effects are actually incurred and recognized, they shall be reported in the period in which the accounting change is made. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;&gt; Impracticability</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-9</b>  It shall be deemed impracticable to apply the effects of a change in accounting principle retrospectively only if any of the following conditions exist: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  After making every reasonable effort to do so, the entity is unable to apply the requirement.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Retrospective application requires assumptions about management's intent in a prior period that cannot be independently substantiated.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Retrospective application requires significant estimates of amounts, and it is impossible to distinguish objectively information about those estimates that both: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1.  Provides evidence of circumstances that existed on the date(s) at which those amounts would be recognized, measured, or disclosed under retrospective application 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2.  Would have been available when the financial statements for that prior period were issued.
</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-10</b>  This Subtopic requires a determination of whether information currently available to develop significant estimates would have been available when the affected transactions or events would have been recognized in the financial statements. However, it is not necessary to maintain documentation from the time that an affected transaction or event would have been recognized to determine whether information to develop the estimates would have been available at that time. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;&gt; Justification for a Change in Accounting Principle</b> 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-11</b>  In the preparation of financial statements, once an accounting principle is adopted, it shall be used consistently in accounting for similar events and transactions. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12</b>  An entity may change an accounting principle only if it justifies the use of an allowable alternative accounting principle on the basis that it is preferable. However, a method of accounting that was previously adopted for a type of transaction or event that is being terminated or that was a single, nonrecurring event in the past shall not be changed. For example, the method of accounting shall not be changed for a tax or tax credit that is being discontinued. Additionally, the method of transition elected at the time of adoption of a Codification update shall not be subsequently changed. However, a change in the estimated period to be benefited by an asset, if justified by the facts, shall be recognized as a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">change in accounting estimate</b>. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-13</b>  The issuance of a Codification update that requires use of a new accounting principle, interprets an existing principle, expresses a preference for an accounting principle, or rejects a specific principle may require an entity to change an accounting principle. The issuance of such an update constitutes sufficient support for making such a change. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;&gt; Reporting a Change in Accounting Principle Made in an Interim Period</b> 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-14</b>  A change in accounting principle made in an interim period shall be reported by retrospective application in accordance with paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">250-10-45-5 through 45-8</u>. However, the impracticability exception in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">250-10-45-9</u> may not be applied to prechange interim periods of the fiscal year in which the change is made. When retrospective application to prechange interim periods is impracticable, the desired change may only be made as of the beginning of a subsequent fiscal year. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-15</b>  If a public entity that regularly reports interim information makes an accounting change during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year and does not report the data specified by paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">270-10-50-1</u> in a separate fourth-quarter report or in its annual report, that entity shall include disclosure of the effects of the accounting change on interim-period results, as required by paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">250-10-50-1</u>, in a note to the annual financial statements for the fiscal year in which the change is made. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-16</b>  As indicated in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">270-10-45-15</u>, whenever possible, entities should adopt any accounting changes during the first interim period of a fiscal year. Changes in accounting principles and practices adopted after the first interim period in a fiscal year tend to obscure operating results and complicate disclosure of interim financial information. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Change in Accounting Estimate</b> 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-17</b>  A change in accounting estimate shall be accounted for in the period of change if the change affects that period only or in the period of change and future periods if the change affects both. A <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">change in accounting estimate</b> shall not be accounted for by restating or retrospectively adjusting amounts reported in financial statements of prior periods or by reporting pro forma amounts for prior periods. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-18 </b>  Distinguishing between a change in an accounting principle and a change in an accounting estimate is sometimes difficult. In some cases, a change in accounting estimate is effected by a change in accounting principle. One example of this type of change is a change in method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, nonfinancial assets (hereinafter referred to as depreciation method). The new depreciation method is adopted in partial or complete recognition of a change in the estimated future benefits inherent in the asset, the pattern of consumption of those benefits, or the information available to the entity about those benefits. The effect of the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">change in accounting principle</b>, or the method of applying it, may be inseparable from the effect of the change in accounting estimate. Changes of that type often are related to the continuing process of obtaining additional information and revising estimates and, therefore, shall be considered changes in estimates for purposes of applying this Subtopic. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-19</b>  Like other changes in accounting principle, a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle may be made only if the new accounting principle is justifiable on the basis that it is preferable. For example, an entity that concludes that the pattern of consumption of the expected benefits of an asset has changed, and determines that a new depreciation method better reflects that pattern, may be justified in making a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle</b>. (See paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">250-10-45-12</u>.) 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-20</b>  However, a change to the straight-line method at a specific point in the service life of an asset may be planned at the time some depreciation methods, such as the modified accelerated cost recovery system, are adopted to fully depreciate the cost over the estimated life of the asset. Consistent application of such a policy does not constitute a change in accounting principle for purposes of applying this Subtopic. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Change in Reporting Entity</b> 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-21</b>  When an accounting change results in financial statements that are, in effect, the statements of a different reporting entity, the change shall be retrospectively applied to the financial statements of all prior periods presented to show financial information for the new reporting entity for those periods. Previously issued interim financial information shall be presented on a retrospective basis. However, the amount of interest cost previously capitalized through application of Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">835-20</u> shall not be changed when retrospectively applying the accounting change to the financial statements of prior periods. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Correction of an Error in Previously Issued Financial Statements</b> 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-22</b>  As indicated in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-10-45-1</u>, net income for the period shall include all items of profit and loss recognized during the period, including accruals of estimated losses from loss contingencies, but shall not include corrections of errors from prior periods. As used in this Subtopic, the term period refers to both annual and interim reporting periods. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-23</b>  Any error in the financial statements of a prior period discovered after the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">855-10-25</u>) shall be reported as an error correction, by restating the prior-period financial statements. <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Restatement</b> requires all of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The cumulative effect of the error on periods prior to those presented shall be reflected in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the first period presented.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  An offsetting adjustment, if any, shall be made to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position) for that period.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Financial statements for each individual prior period presented shall be adjusted to reflect correction of the period-specific effects of the error.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-24</b>  Those items that are reported as error corrections shall, in single period statements, be reflected as adjustments of the opening balance of retained earnings. When comparative statements are presented, corresponding adjustments should be made of the amounts of net income (and the components thereof) and retained earnings balances (as well as of other affected balances) for all of the periods reported therein, to reflect the retroactive application of the error corrections. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Corrections Related to Prior Interim Periods of the Current Fiscal Year</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-25</b>  For purposes of this Subtopic, an adjustment related to prior interim periods of the current fiscal year is an adjustment or settlement of litigation or similar claims, of income taxes (except for the effects of retroactive tax legislation), of renegotiation proceedings, or of utility revenue under rate-making processes provided that the adjustment or settlement meets all of the following criteria: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The effect of the adjustment or settlement is material in relation to income from continuing operations of the current fiscal year or in relation to the trend of income from continuing operations or is material by other appropriate criteria.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  All or part of the adjustment or settlement can be specifically identified with and is directly related to business activities of specific prior interim periods of the current fiscal year.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  The amount of the adjustment or settlement could not be reasonably estimated prior to the current interim period but becomes reasonably estimable in the current interim period.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The criterion in (b) is not met solely because of incidental effects such as interest on a settlement. The criterion in (c) would be met by the occurrence of an event with currently measurable effects such as a final decision on a rate order. Treatment as adjustments related to prior interim periods of the current fiscal year shall not be applied to the normal recurring corrections and adjustments that are the result of the use of estimates inherent in the accounting process. Changes in provisions for doubtful accounts shall not be considered to be adjustments related to prior interim periods of the current fiscal year even though the changes result from litigation or similar claims. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-26</b>  If an item of profit or loss occurs in other than the first interim period of the entity's fiscal year and all or a part of the item of profit or loss is an adjustment related to prior interim periods of the current fiscal year, as defined in the preceding paragraph, the item shall be reported as follows: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The portion of the item that is directly related to business activities of the entity during the current interim period, if any, shall be included in the determination of net income for that period. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Prior interim periods of the current fiscal year shall be restated to include the portion of the item that is directly related to business activities of the entity during each prior interim period in the determination of net income for that period. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  The portion of the item that is directly related to business activities of the entity during prior fiscal years, if any, shall be included in the determination of net income of the first interim period of the current fiscal year.
</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Materiality Determination for Correction of an Error </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-27</b>  In determining materiality for the purpose of reporting the correction of an error, amounts shall be related to the estimated income for the full fiscal year and also to the effect on the trend of earnings. Changes that are material with respect to an interim period but not material with respect to the estimated income for the full fiscal year or to the trend of earnings shall be separately disclosed in the interim period. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Historical Summaries of Financial Data </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-28</b>  It has become customary for business entities to present historical, statistical-type summaries of financial data for a number of periods - commonly 5 or 10 years. Whenever error corrections have been recorded during any of the periods included therein, the reported amounts of net income (and the components thereof), as well as other affected items, shall be appropriately restated, with disclosure in the first summary published after the adjustments.
