<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">01 </b>This section addresses additional communications in the auditor's report when the auditor considers it necessary to

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. draw users' attention to a matter or matters presented or disclosed in the financial statements that are of such importance that they are fundamental to users' understanding of the financial statements (emphasis-of-matter paragraph) or
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. draw users' attention to any matter or matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements that are relevant to users' understanding of the audit, the auditor's responsibilities, or the auditor's report (other-matter paragraph).

</p><p id="auc70604">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04 </b>The objective of the auditor, having formed an opinion on the financial statements, is to draw users' attention, when in the auditor's judgment it is necessary to do so, by way of clear additional communication in the auditor's report, to

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. a matter, although appropriately presented or disclosed in the financial statements, that is of such importance that it is fundamental to users' understanding of the financial statements or
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. as appropriate, any other matter that is relevant to users' understanding of the audit, the auditor's responsibilities, or the auditor's report.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definitions</b>
</p><p id="auc70605">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05 </b>For the purposes of generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), the following terms have the meanings attributed as follows:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emphasis-of-matter paragraph. </b>A paragraph included in the auditor's report that is required by GAAS, or is included at the auditor's discretion, and that refers to a matter appropriately presented or disclosed in the financial statements that, in the auditor's professional judgment, is of such importance that it is fundamental to users' understanding of the financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other-matter paragraph. </b>A paragraph included in the auditor's report that is required by GAAS, or is included at the auditor's discretion, and that refers to a matter other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements that, in the auditor's professional judgment, is relevant to users' understanding of the audit, the auditor's responsibilities, or the auditor's report.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requirements</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraphs in the Auditor's Report</b>
</p><p id="auc70606">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06 </b>If the auditor considers it necessary to draw users' attention to a matter appropriately presented or disclosed in the financial statements that, in the auditor's professional judgment, is of such importance that it is fundamental to users' understanding of the financial statements, the auditor should include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph in the auditor's report, provided that the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence that the matter is not materially misstated in the financial statements. Such a paragraph should refer only to information presented or disclosed in the financial statements. (Ref: par. .A2–.A3)
</p><p id="auc70607">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07 </b>When the auditor includes an emphasis-of-matter paragraph in the auditor's report, the auditor should

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. include it immediately after the opinion paragraph in the auditor's report,
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. use the heading "Emphasis of Matter" or other appropriate heading, (Ref: par. .A4)
&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. include in the paragraph a clear reference to the matter being emphasized and to where relevant disclosures that fully describe the matter can be found in the financial statements, and
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. indicate that the auditor's opinion is not modified with respect to the matter emphasized. (Ref: par. .A5)
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other-Matter Paragraphs in the Auditor's Report</b>
</p><p id="auc70608">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08 </b>If the auditor considers it necessary to communicate a matter other than those that are presented or disclosed in the financial statements that, in the auditor's professional judgment, is relevant to  users' understanding of the audit, the auditor's responsibilities, or the auditor's report, the auditor should do so in a paragraph in the auditor's report with the heading "Other Matter" or other appropriate heading. The auditor should include this paragraph immediately after the opinion paragraph and any emphasis-of-matter paragraph or elsewhere in the auditor's report if the content of the other-matter paragraph is relevant to the "Other Reporting Responsibilities" section. (Ref: par. .A6–.A11)
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communication With Those Charged With Governance</b>
</p><p id="auc70609">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09 </b>If the auditor expects to include an emphasis-of-matter or other-matter paragraph in the auditor's report, the auditor should communicate with those charged with governance regarding this expectation and the proposed wording of this paragraph. (Ref: par. .A12)
</p>
<p><b  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Application and Other Explanatory Material</b></p>
<p><b  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section (Ref: par. .02)</b></p>
<p id="auc70609">
    <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A1</b> The AU-C sections identified in exhibits B and C require the auditor to
include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph or other-matter paragraph, respectively, in the auditor's report relating to certain matters. The nature of these
matters is such that they are brought to the attention of users of the auditor's
report in all instances rather than at the discretion of the auditor. The explanatory language provided by such required paragraphs achieves the same objective as an emphasis-of-matter or other-matter paragraph that is included based
on the professional judgment of the auditor (that is, to provide additional communication to the users of the auditor's report). Therefore, the auditor follows
the requirements in this section regarding the form and placement of these
required paragraphs.</p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraphs in the Auditor’s Report</b></p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Circumstances in Which an Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraph May Be
        Necessary (Ref: par. .06)</i></b></p>

    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A2</b> In addition to the required emphasis-of-matter paragraphs listed in
        exhibit B, the following are examples of circumstances when the auditor may
        consider it necessary to include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>An uncertainty relating to the future outcome of unusually important litigation or regulatory action</li>
            <li>A major catastrophe that has had, or continues to have, a significant effect on the entity's financial position</li>
            <li>Significant transactions with related parties</li>
            <li>Unusually important subsequent events</li>
        </ul>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A3</b> Paragraph .06 requires that an emphasis-of-matter paragraph refer
        only to matters appropriately presented or disclosed in the financial statements. To include information in an emphasis-of-matter paragraph about a
        matter beyond what is presented or disclosed in the financial statements may
        raise questions about the appropriateness of such presentation or disclosure.</p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Including an Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraph in the Auditor’s Report
        (Ref: par. .07)</i></b></p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A4</b> If the heading "Emphasis of Matter" is not used, another heading may
        be considered appropriate if it adequately describes the nature of the matter
        being disclosed or communicated.</p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A5</b> The inclusion of an emphasis-of-matter paragraph in the auditor's report does not affect the auditor's opinion. An emphasis-of-matter paragraph is
        not a substitute for either</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>the auditor expressing a qualified opinion or an adverse opinion,
                or disclaiming an opinion, when required by the circumstances of
                a specific audit engagement (see section 705A,<i>Modifications to
                    the Opinion in the Independent Auditor's Report) </i>or</li>
            <li>disclosures in the financial statements that the applicable financial reporting framework requires management to make.</li>
        </ol>

    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other-Matter Paragraphs in the Auditor’s Report (Ref: par. .08)</b></p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Circumstances in Which an Other-Matter Paragraph May Be Necessary</i></b></p>
    <p><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevant to Users' Understanding of the Audit</i></p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A6</b> In the rare circumstance when the auditor is unable to withdraw from
        an engagement even though the possible effect of an inability to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence due to a limitation on the scope of the audit
        imposed by management is pervasive,1 the auditor may consider it necessary
        to include an other-matter paragraph in the auditor's report to explain why it
        is not possible for the auditor to withdraw from the engagement.</p>
    <p><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevant to Users' Understanding of the Auditor's Responsibilities or the Auditor's Report</i></p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A7</b> Law, regulation, or generally accepted practice may require or permit
        the auditor to elaborate on matters that provide further explanation of the auditor's responsibilities in the audit of the financial statements or the auditor's
        report thereon. When relevant, one or more subheadings may be used that describe the content of the other-matter paragraph.</p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A8</b> An other-matter paragraph does not address circumstances when the
        auditor has other reporting responsibilities that are in addition to the auditor's
        responsibility under GAAS to report on the financial statements (see the "Other
        Reporting Responsibilities" section in section 700A, Forming an Opinion and
        Reporting on Financial Statements) or when the auditor has been asked to perform and report on additional specified procedures or to express an opinion on
        specific matters.</p>
    <p><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reporting on More Than One Set of Financial Statements</i></p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A9</b> An entity may prepare one set of financial statements in accordance
        with a general purpose framework (for example, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) and another set of financial statements in accordance with another general purpose framework (for example, International Financial Reporting Standards promulgated by the International
        Accounting Standards Board) and engage the auditor to report on both sets of
        financial statements. If the auditor has determined that the frameworks are
        acceptable in the respective circumstances, the auditor may include an othermatter paragraph in the auditor's report referring to the fact that another set of
        financial statements has been prepared by the same entity in accordance with
        another general purpose framework and that the auditor has issued a report
        on those financial statements.</p>
    <p><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Including an Other-Matter Paragraph in the Auditor's Report</i></p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A10</b> The content of an other-matter paragraph reflects clearly that such
        other matter is not required to be presented and disclosed in the financial statements. An other-matter paragraph does not include information that the auditor is prohibited from providing by law, regulation, or other professional standards (for example, ethical standards relating to the confidentiality of information). An other-matter paragraph also does not include information that is
        required to be provided by management.</p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A11</b> The placement of an other-matter paragraph depends on the nature
        of the information to be communicated. When an other-matter paragraph is included to draw users' attention to a matter relevant to their understanding of
        the audit of the financial statements, the paragraph is included immediately
        after the opinion paragraph and any emphasis-of-matter paragraph. When an
        other-matter paragraph is included to draw users' attention to a matter relating to other reporting responsibilities addressed in the auditor's report, the
        paragraph may be included in the section subtitled "Report on Other Legal and
        Regulatory Requirements." Alternatively, when relevant to all the auditor's responsibilities or users' understanding of the auditor's report, the other-matter
        paragraph may be included as a separate section following the "Report on the
        Financial Statements" and the "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements."</p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communication With Those Charged With Governance
        (Ref: par. .09)</b></p>
    <p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A12</b> The auditor's communication with those charged with governance, as
        described in paragraph .09, enables those charged with governance to be made
        aware of the nature of any specific matters that the auditor intends to highlight
        in the auditor's report and provides them with an opportunity to obtain further
        clarification from the auditor, when necessary. When the inclusion of an othermatter paragraph on a particular matter in the auditor's report recurs on each
        successive engagement, the auditor may determine that it is unnecessary to
        repeat the communication on each engagement.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b><i>Auditor’s Responsibility</i></b></p>
<p>Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
    on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require
    that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.</p>
<p>An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the
        amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected
        depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
        In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
        the entity's internal control.2 Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,
        as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.</p>

    <li>The auditor's report on the prior period financial statements expressed an adverse opinion due to identified departures from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
        America that resulted in the financial statements being materially misstated. The entity has elected to change its method of accounting for the matters that gave rise to the adverse opinion in
        the prior period, and has restated the prior period financial statements. Therefore, the auditor has expressed an unmodified opinion on the comparative financial statements</li>
    <li>The auditor's report includes an other-matter paragraph indicating that the updated report on the financial statements of the prior
        period contains an opinion different from the opinion previously

    <li>Although the entity changed its method of accounting for the matters that gave rise to the adverse opinion in the prior period, the
        principal objective of the communication in the other-matter paragraph is to draw users' attention to the change in the auditor's
        opinion on the prior period financial statements. The other-matter
        paragraph also refers to the change in accounting principle and
        the related disclosure in the financial statements. Therefore, the
        other-matter paragraph also meets the objective of communicating the change in accounting principle as required by section 708,
        Consistency of Financial Statements, and a separate emphasis-ofmatter paragraph is not considered necessary.</li>

    generally accepted in the United States of America because of two departures
    from such principles: (1) ABC Company carried its property, plant, and equipment at appraisal values, and provided for depreciation on the basis of such
    values, and (2) ABC Company did not provide for deferred income taxes with
    respect to differences between income for financial reporting purposes and taxable income. As described in Note X, the Company has changed its method
    of accounting for these items and restated its 20X0 financial statements to
    conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of

    Due to a Material Misstatement of the Financial Statements and
    an Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraph Because There Is Uncertainty

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Circumstances include the following:</p>
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <li>Audit of a complete set of general purpose financial statements
        (single year) prepared in accordance with accounting principles
        generally accepted in the United States of America.</li>
    <li>Inventories are misstated. The misstatement is deemed to be material but not pervasive to the financial statements.</li>
    <li>There is uncertainty relating to a pending unusually important

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>[Appropriate Addressee]</i></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Report on the Financial Statements</b></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have audited the accompanying financial statements of ABC Company,
    which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 20X1, and related statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year
    then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements</i></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
    financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
    presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
    whether due to fraud or error.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Auditor’s Responsibility</i></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
    on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require
    that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected
    depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
    In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements
    in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
    but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.2 Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
    also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
    the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,
    as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
    We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b><i>Basis for Qualified Opinion</i></b></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Company has stated inventories at cost in the accompanying balance sheet.
    Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require inventories to be stated at the lower of cost or market. If the Company
    stated inventories at the lower of cost or market, a write down of $XXX would
    have been required as of December 31, 20X1. Accordingly, cost of sales would
    have been increased by $XXX and net income, income taxes, and stockholders'
    equity would have been reduced by $XXX, $XXX, and $XXX, as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 20X1, respectively.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b><i>Qualified Opinion</i></b></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis
    for Qualified Opinion paragraph, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ABC Company
    as of December 31, 20X1, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
    for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b><i>Emphasis of Matter</i>
</b></p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company is a defendant in a lawsuit [briefly describe the nature of the litigation consistent with the
    Company's description in the note to the financial statements]. Our opinion is
    not modified with respect to this matter.</p>
