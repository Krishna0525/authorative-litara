</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section applies to auditors' reports issued in connection with audits fn 1 of historical financial statements that are intended to present financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. It distinguishes the types of reports, describes the circumstances in which each is appropriate, and provides example reports.
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02</b>This section does not apply to unaudited financial statements as described in section 504, <i>Association With Financial Statements,</i> nor does it apply to reports on incomplete financial information or other special presentations as described in section 623, <i>Special Reports.</i>
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03</b> Justification for the expression of the auditor's opinion rests on the conformity of his or her audit with generally accepted auditing standards and on the findings. Generally accepted auditing standards include four standards of reporting. fn 2 This section is concerned primarily with the relationship of the fourth reporting standard to the language of the auditor's report.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reports on Comparative Financial Statements</b>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.65 </b>The fourth standard of reporting requires that the auditor either express an opinion regarding the financial statements <i>taken as a whole</i> or an assertion to the effect that an opinion cannot be expressed, in the auditor’s report. Reference in the fourth reporting standard to the financial statements <i>taken as a whole</i> applies not only to the financial statements of the current period but also to those of one or more prior periods that are presented on a comparative basis with those of the current period. Therefore, a continuing auditorshould update the report on the individual financial statements of the one or more prior periods presented on a comparative basis with those of the current period. Ordinarily, the auditor's report on comparative financial statements should not be dated earlier than the date on which the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to support the opinion for the most recent audit. (See section 530, <i>Dating of the Independent Auditor's Report,</i> paragraph .01.) [Paragraph renumbered by the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 79, December 1995. As amended, effective September 2002, by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 98. Revised, December 2005, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 103.] 
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.66 </b>During the audit of the current-period financial statements, the auditor should be alert for circumstances or events that affect the prior-period financial statements presented (see paragraph .68) or the adequacy of informative disclosures concerning those statements. (See section 431,<i>Adequacy of Disclosure in Financial Statements,</i> and FASB ASC 205, <i>Presentation of Financial Statements.</i>) In updating his or her report on the prior-period financial statements, the auditor should consider the effects of any such circumstances or events coming to his or her attention. [Paragraph renumbered by the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 79, December 1995. Revised, June 2009, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of FASB ASC.]
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.68</b> If, during the current audit, an auditor becomes aware of circumstances or events that affect the financial statements of a prior period, he or she should consider such matters when updating his or her report on the financial statements of the prior period. For example, if an auditor has previously qualified his or her opinion or expressed an adverse opinion on financial statements of a prior period because of a departure from generally accepted accounting principles, and the prior-period financial statements are restated in the current period to conform with generally accepted accounting principles, the auditor's updated report on the financial statements of the prior period should indicate that the statements have been restated and should express an unqualified opinion with respect to the restated financial statements. [Paragraph renumbered by the issuance of Statement on Auditing Standards No. 79, December 1995.]
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.69</b> If, in an updated report, the opinion is different from the opinion previously expressed on the financial statements of a prior period, the auditor should disclose all the substantive reasons for the different opinion in a separate explanatory paragraph(s) preceding the opinion paragraph of his or her report. The explanatory paragraph(s) should disclose <i>(a)</i> the date of the auditor's previous report, <i>(b)</i> the type of opinion previously expressed, <i>(c)</i> the circumstances or events that caused the auditor to express a different opinion, and <i>(d)</i> that the auditor's updated opinion on the financial statements of the prior period is different from his or her previous opinion on those statements. The following is an example of an explanatory paragraph that may be appropriate when an auditor issues an updated report on the financial statements of a prior period that contains an opinion different from the opinion previously expressed:
<br/><br/>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09</b> Typically, management and employees engaged in fraud will take steps to conceal the fraud from the auditors and others within and outside the organization. Fraud may be concealed by withholding evidence or misrepresenting information in response to inquiries or by falsifying documentation. For example, management that engages in fraudulent financial reporting might alter shipping documents. Employees or members of management who misappropriate cash might try to conceal their thefts by forging signatures or falsifying electronic approvals on disbursement authorizations. An audit conducted in accordance with GAAS rarely involves the authentication of such documentation, nor are auditors trained as or expected to be experts in such authentication. In addition, an auditor may not discover the existence of a modification of documentation through a side agreement that management or a third party has not disclosed.

	<u>Independent Auditor's Report</u>
	<br/>
	<i>[Same first and second paragraphs as the standard report]</i></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;">
	<li>
		In our report dated March 1, 20X2, we expressed an opinion that the 20X1 financial statements did not fairly present financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America because of two departures from such principles: (1) the Company carried its property, plant, and equipment at appraisal values, and provided for depreciation on the basis of such values, and (2) the Company did not provide for deferred income taxes with respect to differences between income for financial reporting purposes and taxable income. As described in Note X, the Company has changed its method of accounting for these items and restated its 20X1 financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accordingly, our present opinion on the 20X1 financial statements, as presented herein, is different from that expressed in our previous report.
	</li>
	<li><br/></li>
	<li>
		In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of X Company as of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
