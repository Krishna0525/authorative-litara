<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Other Presentation Matters Section provides guidance on other presentation matters not addressed in the Recognition, Initial Measurement, Subsequent Measurement, and Derecognition Sections. Other presentation matters may include items such as current or long-term balance sheet classification, cash flow presentation, earnings per share matters, and so forth. The FASB Codification also contains Presentation Topics, which provide guidance for general presentation and display items. See those Topics for general guidance.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Balance Sheet Classification</b>
</p><p id="32045">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-1</b>  An entity shall report its investments in <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">available-for-sale securities</b> and trading securities separately from similar assets that are subsequently measured using another measurement attribute on the face of the statement of financial position. To accomplish that, an entity shall do either of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Present the aggregate of those <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fair value</b> and non-fair-value amounts in the same line item and parenthetically disclose the amount of fair value included in the aggregate amount 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Present two separate line items to display the fair value and non-fair-value carrying amounts. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-2</b>  An entity that presents a classified statement of financial position shall report individual held-to-maturity securities, individual available-for-sale securities, and individual trading securities as either current or noncurrent, as appropriate, under the guidance of Section <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">210-10-45</u>. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;  Presentation of Deferred Tax Assets Relating to Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-3</b>  An entity that recognizes a deferred tax asset relating only to a net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities may at the same time conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all of that deferred tax asset will not be realized. In that circumstance, the entity shall report the offsetting entry to the valuation allowance in the component of other comprehensive income classified as unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">debt securities</b> and <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">equity securities</b> because the valuation allowance is directly related to the unrealized holding loss on the available-for-sale securities. The entity shall also report the offsetting entry to the valuation allowance in the component of other comprehensive income classified as unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities if the entity concludes on the need for a valuation allowance in a later interim period of the same fiscal year in which the deferred tax asset is initially recognized. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4</b>  An entity that does not need to recognize a valuation allowance at the same time that it establishes a deferred tax asset relating to a net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities may, in a subsequent fiscal year, conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all of that deferred tax asset will not be realized. In that circumstance, if an entity initially decided that no valuation allowance was required at the time the unrealized loss was recognized but in a subsequent fiscal year decides that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance shall be recognized. The entity shall include the offsetting entry as an item in determining income from continuing operations. The offsetting entry shall not be included in other comprehensive income. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-5</b>  An entity that recognizes a deferred tax asset relating to a net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities may, at the same time, conclude that a valuation allowance is warranted and in a subsequent fiscal year makes a change in judgment about the level of future years' taxable income such that all or a portion of that valuation allowance is no longer warranted. In that circumstance, the entity shall include any reversals in the valuation allowance due to such a change in judgment in subsequent fiscal years as an item in determining income from continuing operations, even though initial recognition of the valuation allowance affected the component of other comprehensive income classified as unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities. If, rather than a change in judgment about future years' taxable income, the entity generates taxable income in the current year (subsequent to the year the related deferred tax asset was recognized) that can use the benefit of the deferred tax asset, the elimination (or reduction) of the valuation allowance is allocated to that taxable income. Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-45-20</u> provides additional information. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-6</b>  An entity that has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to other deductible temporary differences in a previous fiscal year may at the same time have concluded that no valuation allowance was warranted. If in the current year an entity recognizes a deferred tax asset relating to a net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities that arose in the current year and at the same time concludes that a valuation allowance is warranted, management shall determine the extent to which the valuation allowance is directly related to the unrealized loss and the other deductible temporary differences, such as an accrual for other postemployment benefits. The entity shall report the offsetting entry to the valuation allowance in the component of other comprehensive income classified as unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities only to the extent the valuation allowance is directly related to the unrealized loss on the available-for-sale securities that arose in the current year. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Income Statement Classification </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-7</b>  This Subtopic does not specify the income statement classification of gains and losses for transfers involving trading securities. However, gains and losses that have accumulated before the transfer shall be classified consistently with realized gains and losses for the category from which the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">security</b> is being transferred, not the category into which the security is being transferred. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-8</b>  Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-35-1</u> explains that all or a portion of the unrealized holding gain and loss of an available-for-sale security that is designated as being hedged in a fair value hedge shall be recognized in earnings during the period of the hedge, pursuant to paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-25-35-1 through 35-4</u>. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Other-Than-Temporary Impairment </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-8A</b>  In periods in which an entity determines that a securityￃﾢￂￂﾙs decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis is other than temporary, the entity shall present the total other-than-temporary impairment in the statement of earnings with an offset for the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment that is recognized in other comprehensive income, in accordance with paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-35-34D</u>, if any. Example 2A (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-55-21A</u>) illustrates the application of this guidance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Other Comprehensive Income </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-9</b>  Subsequent increases in the fair value of available-for-sale securities shall be included in other comprehensive income pursuant to paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-35-1(b)</u> and <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-45-8</u>; subsequent decreases in fair value, if not an other-than-temporary impairment, also shall be included in other comprehensive income. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment</b>  </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-45-9A</b>  An entity shall separately present, in the financial statement in which the components of accumulated other comprehensive income are reported, amounts recognized therein related to held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities for which a portion of an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized in earnings.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Tax Effects of Unrealized Holding Gains and Losses </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-10</b>  Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-20-45-11(b)</u> provides guidance on reporting the tax effects of unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Cash Flow Presentation </b> </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-11</b>  Cash flows from purchases, sales, and maturities of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities shall be classified as cash flows from investing activities and reported gross for each security classification in the statement of cash flows. Cash flows from purchases, sales, and maturities of trading securities shall be classified based on the nature and purpose for which the securities were acquired. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12</b>  Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">230-10-45-8</u> permits reporting activity in cash equivalents as a net change. However, securities that are considered cash equivalents are subject to the accounting and disclosure requirements of this Subtopic, such as disclosure of amortized cost and fair value by major security types. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-13</b>  This Subtopic does not require the presentation of individual amounts for the three categories of investments on the face of the statement of financial position, provided the information is presented in the notes. Thus, entities that report certain investments in debt securities as cash equivalents in accordance with the provisions of Topic 230 can continue that practice, provided that the notes reconcile the reporting classifications used in the statement of financial position.
