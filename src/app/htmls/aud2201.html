<P class="p3 ft7">.03 The auditor's objective in an audit of internal control over financial reporting is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Because a company's internal control cannot be considered effective if one or more material weaknesses exist, to form a basis for expressing an opinion, the auditor must plan and perform the audit to obtain appropriate evidence that is sufficient to obtain reasonable assurance<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_ftn5">​</A><A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_ftn5"><SPAN class="ft5">5</SPAN></A><SPAN class="ft6">​</SPAN>about whether material weaknesses exist as of the date specified in management's assessment.

In such circumstances, the auditor's tests of the operating effectiveness of controls would be performed principally for the purpose of supporting his or her opinion on whether the company's internal control over financial reporting is effective as of <NOBR>year-end.</NOBR> The results of the auditor's financial statement auditing procedures also should inform his or her risk assessments in determining the testing necessary to conclude on the effectiveness of a control.</P>
<P class="p15 ft0">Planning the Audit</P>
<P class="p16 ft8">.09 The auditor should properly plan the audit of internal control over financial reporting and properly supervise the engagement team members.

<P class="p31 ft14"><SPAN class="ft25">assertion</SPAN>​s, the selection of controls to test, and the determination of the evidence necessary for a given control.</P>
<P class="p32 ft7">.11 A direct relationship exists between the degree of risk that a material weakness could exist in a particular area of the company's internal control over financial reporting and the amount of audit attention that should be devoted to that area. In addition, the risk that a company's internal control over financial reporting will fail to prevent or detect misstatement caused by fraud usually is higher than the risk of failure to prevent or detect error. The auditor should focus more of his or her attention on the areas of highest risk. On the other hand, it is not necessary to test controls that, even if deficient, would not present a reasonable possibility of material misstatement to the financial statements.</P>
<P class="p33 ft18">.12 The complexity of the organization, business unit, or process, will play an important role in the auditor's risk assessment and the determination of the necessary procedures.</P>
<P class="p34 ft12">Scaling the Audit</P>
<P class="p35 ft28">.13 The size and complexity of the company, its business processes, and business units, may affect the way in which the company achieves many of its ​<SPAN class="ft26">control objective</SPAN>​s. The size and complexity of the company also might affect the risks of misstatement and the controls necessary to address those risks. Scaling is most effective as a natural extension of the <NOBR>risk-based</NOBR> approach and applicable to the audits of all companies. Accordingly, a smaller, less complex company, or even a larger, less complex company might achieve its control objectives differently than a more complex company.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_ftn9">​</A><A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_ftn9"><SPAN class="ft27">9</SPAN></A></P>

<P class="p0 ft12">Using the Work of Others</P>
<P class="p42 ft14">.16 The auditor should evaluate the extent to which he or she will use the work of others to reduce the work the auditor might otherwise perform himself or herself. AS 2605, ​<SPAN class="ft30">Consideration of the Internal Audit Function, ​</SPAN>applies in an integrated audit of the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting.</P>
<P class="p43 ft8">.17 For purposes of the audit of internal control, however, the auditor may use the work performed by, or receive direct assistance from, internal auditors, company personnel (in addition to internal auditors), and third parties working under the direction of management or the audit committee that provides evidence about the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In an integrated audit of internal control over financial reporting and the financial statements, the auditor also may use this work to obtain evidence supporting the auditor's assessment of control risk for purposes of the audit of the financial statements.</P>
<P class="p44 ft8">.18 The auditor should assess the competence and objectivity of the persons whose work the auditor plans to use to determine the extent to which the auditor may use their work. The higher the degree of competence and objectivity, the greater use the auditor may make of the work. The auditor should apply AS 2605.09 through .11 to assess the competence and objectivity of internal auditors. The auditor should apply the principles underlying those paragraphs to assess the competence and objectivity of persons other than internal auditors whose work the auditor plans to use.</P>
<P class="p45 ft14">Note: For purposes of using the work of others, competence means the attainment and maintenance of a level of understanding and knowledge that enables that person to perform ably the tasks assigned to them, and objectivity means the ability to perform those tasks impartially and with</P>

<P class="p46 ft8">intellectual honesty. To assess competence, the auditor should evaluate factors about the person's qualifications and ability to perform the work the auditor plans to use. To assess objectivity, the auditor should evaluate whether factors are present that either inhibit or promote a person's ability to perform with the necessary degree of objectivity the work the auditor plans to use.</P>
<P class="p47 ft8">Note: The auditor should not use the work of persons who have a low degree of objectivity, regardless of their level of competence. Likewise, the auditor should not use the work of persons who have a low level of competence regardless of their degree of objectivity. Personnel whose core function is to serve as a testing or compliance authority at the company, such as internal auditors, normally are expected to have greater competence and objectivity in performing the type of work that will be useful to the auditor.</P>
<P class="p48 ft14">.19 The extent to which the auditor may use the work of others in an audit of internal control also depends on the risk associated with the control being tested. As the risk associated with a control increases, the need for the auditor to perform his or her own work on the control increases.</P>
<P class="p49 ft12">Materiality</P>
<P class="p50 ft18">.20 In planning the audit of internal control over financial reporting, the auditor should use the same materiality considerations he or she would use in planning the audit of the company's annual financial statements.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_11">​</A><A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_11"><SPAN class="ft5">11</SPAN></A></P>

<P class="p52 ft13">.21 The auditor should use a <NOBR>top-down</NOBR> approach to the audit of internal control over financial reporting to select the controls to test. A <NOBR>top-down</NOBR> approach begins at the financial statement level and with the auditor's understanding of the overall risks to internal control over financial reporting. The auditor then focuses on <NOBR>entity-level</NOBR> controls and works down to significant accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions. This approach directs the auditor's attention to accounts, disclosures, and assertions that present a reasonable possibility of material misstatement to the ​<SPAN class="ft31">financial statements and related disclosures</SPAN>​. The auditor then verifies his or her understanding of the risks in the company's processes and selects for testing those controls that sufficiently address the assessed risk of misstatement to each relevant assertion.</P>

<P class="p93 ft4">Note: In the financial statement audit, the auditor might perform substantive auditing procedures on financial statement accounts, disclosures and assertions that are not determined to be significant accounts and disclosures and relevant assertions.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_13">​</A><A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_13"><SPAN class="ft2">13</SPAN></A></P>
<P class="p94 ft14">.32 The components of a potential significant account or disclosure might be subject to significantly differing risks. If so, different controls might be necessary to adequately address those risks.</P>
<P class="p95 ft14">.33 When a company has multiple locations or business units, the auditor should identify significant accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions based on the consolidated financial statements. Having made those determinations, the auditor should then apply the direction in Appendix B for multiple locations scoping decisions.</P>
<P class="p49 ft12">Understanding Likely Sources of Misstatement</P>
<P class="p96 ft11">.34 To further understand the likely sources of potential misstatements, and as a part of selecting the controls to test, the auditor should achieve the following objectives -</P>

<P class="p102 ft13">.35 Because of the degree of judgment required, the auditor should either perform the procedures that achieve the objectives in paragraph .34 himself or herself or supervise the work of others who provide direct assistance to the auditor, as described in AS 2605.</P>
<P class="p103 ft14">.36 The auditor also should understand how IT affects the company's flow of transactions. The auditor should apply paragraph .29 and Appendix B of AS 2110, which discuss the effect of information technology on internal control over financial reporting and the risks to assess.</P>
<P class="p104 ft8">Note: The identification of risks and controls within IT is not a separate evaluation. Instead, it is an integral part of the <NOBR>top-down</NOBR> approach used to identify significant accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions, and the controls to test, as well as to assess risk and allocate audit effort as described by this standard.</P>

<P class="p106 ft8">the auditor follows a transaction from origination through the company's processes, including information systems, until it is reflected in the company's financial records, using the same documents and information technology that company personnel use. Walkthrough procedures usually include a combination of inquiry, observation, inspection of relevant documentation, and <NOBR>re-performance</NOBR> of controls.</P>
<P class="p107 ft8">.38 In performing a walkthrough, at the points at which important processing procedures occur, the auditor questions the company's personnel about their understanding of what is required by the company's prescribed procedures and controls. These probing questions, combined with the other walkthrough procedures, allow the auditor to gain a sufficient understanding of the process and to be able to identify important points at which a necessary control is missing or not designed effectively. Additionally, probing questions that go beyond a narrow focus on the single transaction used as the basis for the walkthrough allow the auditor to gain an understanding of the different types of significant transactions handled by the process.</P>
<P class="p108 ft12">Selecting Controls to Test</P>
<P class="p109 ft8">.39 ​ <SPAN class="ft9">​</SPAN>The auditor should test those controls that are important to the auditor's conclusion about whether the company's controls sufficiently address the assessed risk of misstatement to each relevant assertion.</P>
<P class="p110 ft8">.40 There might be more than one control that addresses the assessed risk of misstatement to a particular relevant assertion; conversely, one control might address the assessed risk of misstatement to more than one relevant assertion. It is neither necessary to test all controls related to a relevant assertion nor necessary to test redundant controls, unless redundancy is itself a control objective.</P>

<DIV id="id18_1">
<P class="p111 ft4">.41 The decision as to whether a control should be selected for testing depends on which controls, individually or in combination, sufficiently address the assessed risk of misstatement to a given relevant assertion rather than on how the control is labeled (​<SPAN class="ft38">e.g.​</SPAN>, <NOBR>entity-level</NOBR> control, <NOBR>transaction-level</NOBR> control, control activity, monitoring control, <SPAN class="ft1">preventive control</SPAN>​, ​<SPAN class="ft1">detective control</SPAN>​).</P>
<P class="p112 ft0">Testing Controls</P>
<P class="p113 ft12">Testing Design Effectiveness</P>
<P class="p114 ft8">.42 The auditor should test the design effectiveness of controls by determining whether the company's controls, if they are operated as prescribed by persons possessing the necessary authority and competence to perform the control effectively, satisfy the company's control objectives and can effectively prevent or detect errors or fraud that could result in material misstatements in the financial statements.</P>
<P class="p115 ft8">Note: A smaller, less complex company might achieve its control objectives in a different manner from a larger, more complex organization. For example, a smaller, less complex company might have fewer employees in the accounting function, limiting opportunities to segregate duties and leading the company to implement alternative controls to achieve its control objectives. In such circumstances, the auditor should evaluate whether those alternative controls are effective.</P>
<P class="p116 ft11">.43 Procedures the auditor performs to test design effectiveness include a mix of inquiry of appropriate personnel, observation of the company's operations, and</P>

<P class="p117 ft11">inspection of relevant documentation. Walkthroughs that include these procedures ordinarily are sufficient to evaluate design effectiveness.</P>
<P class="p118 ft12">Testing Operating Effectiveness</P>
<P class="p114 ft14">.44 The auditor should test the operating effectiveness of a control by determining whether the control is operating as designed and whether the person performing the control possesses the necessary authority and competence to perform the control effectively.</P>
<P class="p119 ft28">Note: In some situations, particularly in smaller companies, a company might use a third party to provide assistance with certain financial reporting functions. When assessing the competence of personnel responsible for a company's financial reporting and associated controls, the auditor may take into account the combined competence of company personnel and other parties that assist with functions related to financial reporting.</P>
<P class="p120 ft14">.45 Procedures the auditor performs to test operating effectiveness include a mix of inquiry of appropriate personnel, observation of the company's operations, inspection of relevant documentation, and <NOBR>re-performance</NOBR> of the control.</P>
<P class="p121 ft12">Relationship of Risk to the Evidence to be Obtained</P>
<P class="p122 ft14">.46 For each control selected for testing, the evidence necessary to persuade the auditor that the control is effective depends upon the risk associated with the control. The risk associated with a control consists of the risk that the control might not be effective and, if not effective, the risk that a material weakness would result. As the risk</P>

<P class="p123 ft8">Note: Although the auditor must obtain evidence about the effectiveness of controls for each relevant assertion, the auditor is not responsible for obtaining sufficient evidence to support an opinion about the effectiveness of each individual control. Rather, the auditor's objective is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting overall. This allows the auditor to vary the evidence obtained regarding the effectiveness of individual controls selected for testing based on the risk associated with the individual control.</P>
<P class="p108 ft15">.47 Factors that affect the risk associated with a control include -</P>
<P class="p124 ft11"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">The nature and materiality of misstatements that the control is intended to prevent or detect;</SPAN></P>

<P class="p130 ft8">Note: A less complex company or business unit with simple business processes and centralized accounting operations might have relatively simple information systems that make greater use of <NOBR>off-the-shelf</NOBR> packaged software without modification. In the areas in which <NOBR>off-the-shelf</NOBR> software is used, the auditor's testing of information technology controls might focus on the application controls built into the <NOBR>pre-packaged</NOBR> software that management relies on to achieve its control objectives and the IT general controls that are important to the effective operation of those application controls.</P>

<P class="p132 ft14">Note: Generally, a conclusion that a control is not operating effectively can be supported by less evidence than is necessary to support a conclusion that a control is operating effectively.</P>
<P class="p133 ft14">.48 When the auditor identifies deviations from the company's controls, he or she should determine the effect of the deviations on his or her assessment of the risk associated with the control being tested and the evidence to be obtained, as well as on the operating effectiveness of the control.</P>

<P class="p134 ft14">Note: Because effective internal control over financial reporting cannot, and does not, provide absolute assurance of achieving the company's control objectives, an individual control does not necessarily have to operate without any deviation to be considered effective.</P>
<P class="p108 ft7">.49 The evidence provided by the auditor's tests of the effectiveness of controls depends upon the mix of the nature, timing, and extent of the auditor's procedures. Further, for an individual control, different combinations of the nature, timing, and extent of testing may provide sufficient evidence in relation to the risk associated with the control.</P>
<P class="p135 ft8">Note: Walkthroughs usually consist of a combination of inquiry of appropriate personnel, observation of the company's operations, inspection of relevant documentation, and <NOBR>re-performance</NOBR> of the control and might provide sufficient evidence of operating effectiveness, depending on the risk associated with the control being tested, the specific procedures performed as part of the walkthrough and the results of those procedures.</P>
<P class="p136 ft8">.50 ​<SPAN class="ft9">Nature of Tests of Controls​</SPAN>. Some types of tests, by their nature, produce greater evidence of the effectiveness of controls than other tests.

<DIV id="id23_1">
<P class="p138 ft8">.51 The nature of the tests of effectiveness that will provide appropriate evidence depends, to a large degree, on the nature of the control to be tested, including whether the operation of the control results in documentary evidence of its operation. Documentary evidence of the operation of some controls, such as management's philosophy and operating style, might not exist.</P>
<P class="p139 ft8">Note: A smaller, less complex company or unit might have less formal documentation regarding the operation of its controls. In those situations, testing controls through inquiry combined with other procedures, such as observation of activities, inspection of less formal documentation, or <NOBR>re-performance</NOBR> of certain controls, might provide sufficient evidence about whether the control is effective.</P>
<P class="p140 ft28">.52 ​<SPAN class="ft41">Timing of Tests of Controls​</SPAN>. Testing controls over a greater period of time provides more evidence of the effectiveness of controls than testing over a shorter period of time.

<P class="p112 ft8">.53 Prior to the date specified in management's assessment, management might implement changes to the company's controls to make them more effective or efficient or to address control deficiencies.

<P class="p151 ft12">Special Considerations for Subsequent Years' Audits</P>
<P class="p152 ft7">.57 In subsequent years' audits, the auditor should incorporate knowledge obtained during past audits he or she performed of the company's internal control over financial reporting into the <NOBR>decision-making</NOBR> process for determining the nature, timing, and extent of testing necessary. This <NOBR>decision-making</NOBR> process is described in paragraphs .46 through .56.</P>
<P class="p153 ft11">.58 Factors that affect the risk associated with a control in subsequent years' audits include those in paragraph .47 and the following -</P>
<P class="p73 ft15"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft22">The nature, timing, and extent of procedures performed in previous audits,</SPAN></P>
<P class="p39 ft15"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft22">The results of the previous years' testing of the control, and</SPAN></P>
<P class="p125 ft11"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">Whether there have been changes in the control or the process in which it operates since the previous audit.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p154 ft14">.59 After taking into account the risk factors identified in paragraphs .47 and .58, the additional information available in subsequent years' audits might permit the auditor to assess the risk as lower than in the initial year. This, in turn, might permit the auditor to reduce testing in subsequent years.</P>
<P class="p155 ft14">.60 The auditor may also use a benchmarking strategy for automated application controls in subsequent years' audits. Benchmarking is described further beginning at paragraph .B28.</P>

<DIV id="id26_1">
<P class="p156 ft8">.61 In addition, the auditor should vary the nature, timing, and extent of testing of controls from year to year to introduce unpredictability into the testing and respond to changes in circumstances. For this reason, each year the auditor might test controls at a different interim period, increase or reduce the number and types of tests performed, or change the combination of procedures used.</P>
<P class="p105 ft0">Evaluating Identified</P>
<P class="p157 ft0">Deficiencies</P>
<P class="p158 ft8">.62 The auditor must evaluate the severity of each control ​<SPAN class="ft25">deficiency</SPAN>​that comes to his or her attention to determine whether the deficiencies, individually or in combination, are material weaknesses as of the date of management's assessment. In planning and performing the audit, however, the auditor is not required to search for deficiencies that, individually or in combination, are less severe than a material weakness.</P>
<P class="p49 ft15">.63 The severity of a deficiency depends on -</P>
<P class="p159 ft14"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">Whether there is a reasonable possibility that the company's controls will fail to prevent or detect a misstatement of an account balance or disclosure; and</SPAN></P>

<P class="p161 ft14">.64 The severity of a deficiency does not depend on whether a misstatement actually has occurred but rather on whether there is a reasonable possibility that the company's controls will fail to prevent or detect a misstatement.</P>

<P class="p163 ft11"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">The nature of the financial statement accounts, disclosures, and assertions involved;</SPAN></P>
<P class="p23 ft15"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft22">The susceptibility of the related asset or liability to loss or fraud;</SPAN></P>
<P class="p164 ft11"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">The subjectivity, complexity, or extent of judgment required to determine the amount involved;</SPAN></P>
<P class="p80 ft11"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">The interaction or relationship of the control with other controls, including whether they are interdependent or redundant;</SPAN></P>

<P class="p39 ft15"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft22">The possible future consequences of the deficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p165 ft14">Note: The evaluation of whether a control deficiency presents a reasonable possibility of misstatement can be made without quantifying the probability of occurrence as a specific percentage or range.</P>
<P class="p166 ft8">Note: Multiple control deficiencies that affect the same financial statement account balance or disclosure increase the likelihood of misstatement and may, in combination, constitute a material weakness, even though such deficiencies may individually be less severe. Therefore, the auditor should determine whether individual control deficiencies that affect the same significant account or disclosure, relevant assertion, or component of internal control collectively result in a material weakness.</P>

<P class="p170 ft7">.67 In evaluating the magnitude of the potential misstatement, the maximum amount that an account balance or total of transactions can be overstated is generally the recorded amount, while understatements could be larger. Also, in many cases, the probability of a small misstatement will be greater than the probability of a large misstatement.</P>
<P class="p171 ft14">.68 The auditor should evaluate the effect of compensating controls when determining whether a control deficiency or combination of deficiencies is a material weakness.

<P class="p253 ft14">.92 The auditor should determine the effect his or her adverse opinion on internal control has on his or her opinion on the financial statements. Additionally, the auditor should disclose whether his or her opinion on the financial statements was affected by the adverse opinion on internal control over financial reporting.</P>
<P class="p254 ft8">Note: If the auditor issues a separate report on internal control over financial reporting in this circumstance, the disclosure required by this paragraph may be combined with the report language described in paragraphs .88 and .91.

<P class="p0 ft37">.B1 ​<SPAN class="ft59">Tests of Controls in an Audit of Internal Control. ​</SPAN>The objective of the tests of controls in an audit of internal control over financial reporting is to obtain evidence about the effectiveness of controls to support the auditor's opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting. The auditor's opinion relates to the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of a ​<SPAN class="ft59">point in time ​</SPAN>and ​<SPAN class="ft59">taken as a whole​</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p292 ft8">.B2 To express an opinion on internal control over financial reporting as of a point in time, the auditor should obtain evidence that internal control over financial reporting has operated effectively for a sufficient period of time, which may be less than the entire period (ordinarily one year) covered by the company's financial statements. To express an opinion on internal control over financial reporting taken as a whole, the auditor must obtain evidence about the effectiveness of selected controls over all relevant assertions. This requires that the auditor test the design and operating effectiveness of controls he or she ordinarily would not test if expressing an opinion only on the financial statements.</P>
<P class="p293 ft8">.B3 When concluding on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for purposes of expressing an opinion on internal control over financial reporting, the auditor should incorporate the results of any additional tests of controls performed to achieve the objective related to expressing an opinion on the financial statements, as discussed in the following section.</P>
<P class="p112 ft38"><SPAN class="ft4">.B4 ​</SPAN>Tests of Controls in an Audit of Financial Statements. ​<SPAN class="ft4">To express an opinion on the financial statements, the auditor ordinarily performs tests of controls and substantive procedures.

<P class="p294 ft14">place reliance on those controls. However, the auditor is not required to assess control risk at less than the maximum for ​<SPAN class="ft30">all ​</SPAN>relevant assertions and, for a variety of reasons, the auditor may choose not to do so.</P>
<P class="p295 ft8">.B5 When concluding on the effectiveness of controls for the purpose of assessing control risk, the auditor also should evaluate the results of any additional tests of controls performed to achieve the objective related to expressing an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting, as discussed in paragraph .B2. Consideration of these results may require the auditor to alter the nature, timing, and extent of substantive procedures and to plan and perform further tests of controls, particularly in response to identified control deficiencies.</P>
<P class="p268 ft9"><SPAN class="ft8">.B6 ​</SPAN>Effect of Tests of Controls on Substantive Procedures. ​<SPAN class="ft8">If, during the audit of internal control over financial reporting, the auditor identifies a deficiency, he or she should determine the effect of the deficiency, if any, on the nature, timing, and extent of substantive procedures to be performed to reduce audit risk in the audit of the financial statements to an appropriately low level.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p206 ft8">.B7 Regardless of the assessed level of control risk or the assessed risk of material misstatement in connection with the audit of the financial statements, the auditor should perform substantive procedures for all relevant assertions. Performing procedures to express an opinion on internal control over financial reporting does not diminish this requirement.</P>

<P class="p303 ft8">.B11 In assessing and responding to risk, the auditor should test controls over specific risks that present a reasonable possibility of material misstatement to the company's consolidated financial statements. In <NOBR>lower-risk</NOBR> locations or business units, the auditor first might evaluate whether testing <NOBR>entity-level</NOBR> controls, including controls in place to provide assurance that appropriate controls exist throughout the organization, provides the auditor with sufficient evidence.</P>
<P class="p304 ft8">.B12 In determining the locations or business units at which to perform tests of controls, the auditor may take into account work performed by others on behalf of management. For example, if the internal auditors' planned procedures include relevant audit work at various locations, the auditor may coordinate work with the internal auditors and reduce the number of locations or business units at which the auditor would otherwise need to perform auditing procedures.</P>
<P class="p118 ft14">.B13 The direction in paragraph .61 regarding special considerations for subsequent years' audits means that the auditor should vary the nature, timing, and extent of testing of controls at locations or business units from year to year.</P>
<P class="p7 ft8">.B14 <SPAN class="ft9">Special Situations. ​</SPAN>The scope of the audit should include entities that are acquired on or before the date of management's assessment and operations that are accounted for as discontinued operations on the date of management's assessment.

<P class="p238 ft8">.B15 For equity method investments, the scope of the audit should include controls over the reporting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, in the company's financial statements, of the company's portion of the investees' income or loss, the investment balance, adjustments to the income or loss and investment balance, and related disclosures. The audit ordinarily would not extend to controls at the equity method investee.</P>
<P class="p305 ft18">.B16 In situations in which the SEC allows management to limit its assessment of internal control over financial reporting by excluding certain entities, the auditor may limit the audit in the same manner. In these situations, the auditor's opinion would not be affected by a scope limitation. However, the auditor should include, either in an additional explanatory paragraph or as part of the Basis for Opinion section in his or her report, a disclosure similar to management's regarding the exclusion of an entity from the scope of both management's assessment and the auditor's audit of internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, the auditor should evaluate the reasonableness of management's conclusion that the situation meets the criteria of the SEC's allowed exclusion and the appropriateness of any required disclosure related to such a limitation. If the auditor believes that management's disclosure about the limitation requires modification, the auditor should follow the same communication responsibilities that are described in paragraphs .29 through .32 of AS 4105, ​<SPAN class="ft17">Reviews of Interim Financial Information​</SPAN>. If management and the audit committee do not respond appropriately, in addition to fulfilling those responsibilities, the auditor should modify his or her report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting to include an explanatory paragraph describing the reasons why the auditor believes management's disclosure requires modification.</P>

<P class="p306 ft7">.B17 AS 2601, ​<SPAN class="ft69">Consideration of an Entity's Use of a Service Organization​</SPAN>, applies to the audit of financial statements of a company that obtains services from another organization that are part of the company's information system. The auditor may apply the relevant concepts described in AS 2601 to the audit of internal control over financial reporting.</P>
<P class="p221 ft7">.B18 AS 2601.03 describes the situation in which a service organization's services are part of a company's information system. If the service organization's services are part of a company's information system, as described therein, then they are part of the information and communication component of the company's internal control over financial reporting. When the service organization's services are part of the company's internal control over financial reporting, the auditor should include the activities of the service organization when determining the evidence required to support his or her opinion.</P>
<P class="p307 ft14">.B19 AS 2601.07 through .16 describe the procedures that the auditor should perform with respect to the activities performed by the service organization. The procedures include -</P>
<P class="p308 ft14"><SPAN class="ft15">a.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft44">Obtaining an understanding of the controls at the service organization that are relevant to the entity's internal control and the controls at the user organization over the activities of the service organization, and</SPAN></P>

<DIV id="id56_1">
<P class="p310 ft14">.B20 Evidence that the controls that are relevant to the auditor's opinion are operating effectively may be obtained by following the procedures described in AS 2601.12. These procedures include -</P>

A service auditor's report that does not include tests of controls, results of the tests, and the service auditor's opinion on operating effectiveness (in other words, "reports on controls placed in operation" described in AS 2601.24​<SPAN class="ft9">a​</SPAN>) does not provide evidence of operating effectiveness. Furthermore, if the evidence regarding operating effectiveness of controls comes from an <NOBR>agreed-upon</NOBR> procedures report rather than a service auditor's report issued pursuant to AS 2601, the auditor should evaluate whether the <NOBR>agreed-upon</NOBR> procedures report provides sufficient evidence in the same manner described in the following paragraph.</P>

<P class="p314 ft7">.B21 If a service auditor's report on controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness is available, the auditor may evaluate whether this report provides sufficient evidence to support his or her opinion. In evaluating whether such a service auditor's report provides sufficient evidence, the auditor should assess the following factors -</P>
<P class="p315 ft11"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">The time period covered by the tests of controls and its relation to the </SPAN><NOBR>as-of</NOBR> date of management's assessment,</P>

<P class="p317 ft11"><SPAN class="ft15">■</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">The results of those tests of controls and the service auditor's opinion on the operating effectiveness of the controls.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p318 ft14">Note: These factors are similar to factors the auditor would consider in determining whether the report provides sufficient evidence to support the auditor's assessed level of control risk in an audit of the financial statements, as described in AS 2601.16.</P>
<P class="p319 ft8">.B22 If the service auditor's report on controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness contains a qualification that the stated control objectives might be achieved only if the company applies controls contemplated in the design of the system by the service organization, the auditor should evaluate whether the company is applying the necessary procedures.</P>

<P class="p320 ft37">.B23 In determining whether the service auditor's report provides sufficient evidence to support the auditor's opinion, the auditor should make inquiries concerning the service auditor's reputation, competence, and independence. Appropriate sources of information concerning the professional reputation of the service auditor are discussed in paragraph .10a of AS 1205, ​<SPAN class="ft59">Part of the Audit Performed by Other Independent Auditors​</SPAN>.</P>
<P class="p51 ft18">.B24 When a significant period of time has elapsed between the time period covered by the tests of controls in the service auditor's report and the date specified in management's assessment, additional procedures should be performed. The auditor should inquire of management to determine whether management has identified any changes in the service organization's controls subsequent to the period covered by the service auditor's report (such as changes communicated to management from the service organization, changes in personnel at the service organization with whom management interacts, changes in reports or other data received from the service organization, changes in contracts or service level agreements with the service organization, or errors identified in the service organization's processing). If management has identified such changes, the auditor should evaluate the effect of such changes on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. The auditor also should evaluate whether the results of other procedures he or she performed indicate that there have been changes in the controls at the service organization.</P>

<P class="p0 ft12">Benchmarking of Automated Controls</P>
<P class="p333 ft11">.B28 Entirely automated application controls are generally not subject to breakdowns due to human failure. This feature allows the auditor to use a "benchmarking" strategy.</P>
<P class="p334 ft8">.B29 If general controls over program changes, access to programs, and computer operations are effective and continue to be tested, and if the auditor verifies that the automated application control has not changed since the auditor established a baseline (​<SPAN class="ft9">i.e.​</SPAN>, last tested the application control), the auditor may conclude that the automated application control continues to be effective without repeating the prior year's specific tests of the operation of the automated application control. The nature and extent of the evidence that the auditor should obtain to verify that the control has not changed may vary depending on the circumstances, including depending on the strength of the company's program change controls.</P>
<P class="p335 ft14">.B30 The consistent and effective functioning of the automated application controls may be dependent upon the related files, tables, data, and parameters. For example, an automated application for calculating interest income might be dependent on the continued integrity of a rate table used by the automated calculation.</P>
<P class="p336 ft14">.B31 To determine whether to use a benchmarking strategy, the auditor should assess the following risk factors. As these factors indicate lower risk, the control being evaluated might be <NOBR>well-suited</NOBR> for benchmarking. As these factors indicate increased risk, the control being evaluated is less suited for benchmarking. These factors are -</P>

<P class="p0 ft8">auditor's decision of whether to serve as the principal auditor of the financial statements. If the auditor decides it is appropriate to serve as the principal auditor of the financial statements, then that auditor also should be the principal auditor of the company's internal control over financial reporting. This relationship results from the requirement that an audit of the financial statements must be performed to audit internal control over financial reporting; only the principal auditor of the financial statements can be the principal auditor of internal control over financial reporting. In this circumstance, the principal auditor of the financial statements must participate sufficiently in the audit of internal control over financial reporting to provide a basis for serving as the principal auditor of internal control over financial reporting.</P>
<P class="p366 ft8">.C9 When serving as the principal auditor of internal control over financial reporting, the auditor should decide whether to make reference in the report on internal control over financial reporting to the audit of internal control over financial reporting performed by the other auditor. In these circumstances, the auditor's decision is based on factors analogous to those of the auditor who uses the work and reports of other independent auditors when reporting on a company's financial statements as described in AS 1205.</P>
<P class="p367 ft4">.C10 The decision about whether to make reference to another auditor in the report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting might differ from the corresponding decision as it relates to the audit of the financial statements. For example, the audit report on the financial statements may make reference to the audit of a significant equity investment performed by another independent auditor, but the report on internal control over financial reporting might not make a similar reference because management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting ordinarily would not extend to controls at the equity method investee.<A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_ftnC1">​</A><A href="https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx#_ftnC1"><SPAN class="ft2">1</SPAN></A></P>
