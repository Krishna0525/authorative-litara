<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc20101">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01</b>  This section addresses the auditor's responsibilities in agreeing upon the terms of the audit engagement with management and, when appropriate, those charged with governance. This includes establishing that certain preconditions for an audit, for which management and, when appropriate, those charged with governance are responsible, are present. Section 220, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quality Control for an Engagement Conducted in Accordance With Generally Accepted Auditing Standards</i>, addresses those aspects of engagement acceptance that are within the control of the auditor.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial Audits, Including Reaudit Engagements</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a27">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A27</b>  An auditor may make a proposal for an audit engagement before being granted permission to make inquiries of a predecessor auditor. The auditor may advise management in the proposal or otherwise that the auditorￃﾢￂￂﾙs acceptance of the engagement cannot be final until the inquiries have been made and the responses of the predecessor auditor have been evaluated.
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a28">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A28</b>  When more than one auditor is considering accepting an engagement, the predecessor auditor is not expected to be available to respond to inquiries until an auditor has been selected by the entity and has accepted the engagement, subject to the evaluation of the communications with the predecessor auditor as provided in paragraph .12.</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a29">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A29</b>  Relevant ethical and professional requirements guide the auditor's communications with the predecessor auditor and management, as well as the predecessor auditor's response. Such requirements provide that, except as permitted by the rules of the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, an auditor is precluded from disclosing confidential information obtained in the course of an engagement unless management specifically consents. Such requirements also provide that both the auditor and the predecessor auditor hold in confidence information obtained from each other. This obligation applies regardless of whether the auditor accepts the engagement.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a30">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A30</b>  In accordance with the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, which states that members have a responsibility to cooperate with each other, the predecessor auditor is expected to respond to the auditor's inquiries promptly and, in the absence of unusual circumstances, fully, on the basis of known facts. If, due to unusual circumstances, such as pending, threatened, or potential litigation; disciplinary proceedings; or other unusual circumstances, the predecessor auditor decides not to respond fully to the inquiries, the predecessor auditor is expected to clearly state that the response is limited.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a31">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A31</b>  The communication with the predecessor auditor may be either written or oral. Matters subject to the auditor's inquiry of the predecessor auditor may include the following:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Information that might bear on the integrity of management</li>

<li>Disagreements with management about accounting policies, auditing procedures, or other similarly significant matters</li>

<li>Communications to those charged with governance regarding fraud and noncompliance with laws or regulations by the entity</li>

<li>Communications to management and those charged with governance regarding significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control</li>

<li>The predecessor auditor's understanding about the reasons for the change of auditors</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<i>Considerations Specific to Governmental Entities</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a32">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A32</b>  When the auditor is required by law or regulation to audit a governmental entity, inquiries of the predecessor auditor for the purpose of obtaining information about whether to accept the engagement may not be relevant. However, inquiries of the predecessor auditor may still be relevant for the purpose of obtaining information that is used by the auditor in planning and performing the audit. <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 12</sup>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recurring Audits</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a33">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A33  </b>The following factors may make it appropriate to revise the terms of the audit engagement:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Any indication that management misunderstands the objective and scope of the audit</li>

<li>Any revised or special terms of the audit engagement</li>

<li>A change of senior management</li>

<li>A significant change in ownership</li>

<li>A significant change in the nature or size of the entity's business</li>

<li>A change in legal or regulatory requirements</li>

<li>A change in the financial reporting framework adopted in the preparation of the financial statements</li>

<li>A change in other reporting requirements</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a34">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A34  </b>The auditor may remind management of the terms of the engagement in writing or orally. A written reminder might be a letter confirming that the terms of the preceding engagement will govern the current engagement. If the reminder is oral, audit documentation may include with whom the discussion took place, when, and the significant points discussed.

<i>Request to Change the Terms of the Audit Engagement</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a35">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A35  </b>A request from management for the auditor to change the terms of the audit engagement may result from a change in circumstances affecting the need for the service, a misunderstanding about the nature of an audit as originally requested, or a restriction on the scope of the audit engagement, whether imposed by management or caused by other circumstances. The auditor, as required by paragraph .14, considers the justification given for the request, particularly the implications of a restriction on the scope of the audit engagement.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a36">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A36  </b>A change in circumstances that affects management's requirements or a misunderstanding concerning the nature of the service originally requested may be considered a reasonable basis for requesting a change in the audit engagement.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a37">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A37  </b>In contrast, a change may not be considered reasonable if the change appears to relate to information that is incorrect, incomplete, or otherwise unsatisfactory. An example might be when the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding receivables and management asks for the audit engagement to be changed to a review engagement to avoid a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Request to Change to a Review or Other Service</i>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a38">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A38  </b>Before agreeing to change an audit engagement to a review or other service, an auditor who was engaged to perform an audit in accordance with GAAS may need to assess, in addition to the matters referred to in paragraphs .A35-.A37Open this link as a new document, any legal or contractual implications of the change.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc201a39">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A39  </b>If the auditor concludes that reasonable justification to change the audit engagement to a review or other service exists, the audit work performed to the date of change may be relevant to the changed engagement; however, the work required to be performed and the report to be issued would be those appropriate to the revised engagement. In order to avoid confusing the reader, the report on the other service would not include reference to the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.  </i>The original audit engagement
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.  </i>Any procedures that may have been performed in the original audit engagement, except when the audit engagement is changed to an engagement to undertake agreed-upon procedures and, thus, reference to the procedures performed is a normal part of the report
