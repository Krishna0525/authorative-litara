<p class="header">&gt;  Entities</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-2</b>  The guidance in the Statement of Cash Flows Topic applies to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities (NFPs), with specific exceptions noted below.  The phrase <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">investors, creditors, and others</i> include donors.  The terms <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">income statement</i> and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">net income</i> apply to a business entity; the terms <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">statement of activities</i> and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">change in net assets</i> apply to an NFP.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-3</b>  A business entity or NFP that provides a set of financial statements that reports both financial position and results of operations shall also provide a statement of cash flows for each period for which results of operations are provided.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-4</b>  The guidance in this Topic does not apply to the following entities:
</p><p>a.  A statement of cash flows is not required to be provided by a defined benefit pension plan that presents financial information in accordance with the provisions of Topic 960.  Other employee benefit plans that present financial information similar to that required by Topic 960 (including the presentation of plan investments at fair value) also are not required to provide a statement of cash flows.  Employee benefit plans are encouraged to include a statement of cash flows with their annual financial statements when that statement would provide relevant information about the ability of the plan to meet future obligations (for example, when the plan invests in assets that are not highly liquid or obtains financing for investments).
</p><p>b.  Provided that the conditions in (c) are met, a statement of cash flows is not required to be provided by the following entities:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1.  An investment company that is subject to the registration and regulatory requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2.  An investment company that has essentially the same characteristics as those subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">3.  A common trust fund, variable annuity account, or similar fund maintained by a bank, insurance entity, or other entity in its capacity as a trustee, administrator, or guardian for the collective investment and reinvestment of moneys.
</p>
</p><p>c.  For an investment company specified in (b) to be exempt from the requirement to provide a statement of cash flows, all of the following conditions must be met:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1.  During the period, substantially all of the entity's investments were highly liquid (for example, marketable securities, and other assets for which a market is readily available).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2.  Substantially all of the entity's investments are carried at market value.  Securities for which market value is determined using matrix pricing techniques would meet this condition.  Other securities for which market value is not readily determinable and for which fair value must be determined in good faith by the board of directors would not.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">3.  The entity had little or no debt, based on the average debt outstanding during the period, in relation to average total assets.  For the purpose of determining average debt outstanding, obligations resulting from redemptions of shares by the entity from unsettled purchases of securities or similar assets, or from covered options written generally may be excluded.  However, any extension of credit by the seller that is not in accordance with standard industry practices for redeeming shares or for settling purchases of investments shall be included in average debt outstanding.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">4.  The entity provides a statement of changes in net assets.
