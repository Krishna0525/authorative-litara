</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01 </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibility to obtain written representations from management and, when appropriate, those charged with governance in an audit of financial statements.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sup>
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02 </b>Continuation of an entity as a going concern is assumed in financial reporting in the absence of significant information to the contrary. Ordinarily, information that significantly contradicts the going concern assumption relates to the entity's inability to continue to meet its obligations as they become due without substantial disposition of assets outside the ordinary course of business, restructuring of debt, externally forced revisions of its operations, or similar actions.
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written Representations as Audit Evidence</b>
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .03</b>Audit evidence is the information used by the auditor in arriving at
the conclusions on which the auditor's opinion is based.1 Written representations
are necessary information that the auditor requires in connection with
the audit of the entity's financial statements. Accordingly, similar to responses
to inquiries, written representations are audit evidence. (Ref: par. .A1)
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .04</b>Although written representations provide necessary audit evidence,
they complement other auditing procedures and do not provide sufficient appropriate
audit evidence on their own about any of the matters with which
they deal. Furthermore, obtaining reliable written representations does not affect
the nature or extent of other audit procedures that the auditor applies to
obtain audit evidence about the fulfillment of management's responsibilities or
about specific assertions.

	<li>obtain written representations from management and, when appropriate,
those charged with governance that they believe that
they have fulfilled their responsibility for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements and for the completeness
of the information provided to the auditor;</li>
<li>support other audit evidence relevant to the financial statements

<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Form of Written Representations</b></div>

<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Doubt About the Reliability of Written Representations</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.22 </b>If the auditor has concerns about the competence, integrity, ethical
values, or diligence of management or about management's commitment to,or enforcement of, these, the auditor should determine the effect that such concerns
may have on the reliability of representations (oral or written) and audit
evidence in general. (Ref: par. .A30)</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.23 </b>In particular, if written representations are inconsistent with other audit
evidence, the auditor should perform audit procedures to attempt to resolve
the matter. If the matter remains unresolved, the auditor should reconsider the
assessment of the competence, integrity, ethical values, or diligence of management
or of management's commitment to, or enforcement of, these and should
determine the effect that this may have on the reliability of representations
(oral or written) and audit evidence in general. (Ref: par. .A31)</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.24 </b>If the auditor concludes that the written representations are not reliable,
the auditor should take appropriate action, including determining the
possible effect on the opinion in the auditor's report in accordance with section
705, Modifications to the Opinion in the Independent Auditor's Report, considering
the requirement in paragraph .25 of this section.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Written Representations About Managements Responsibilities</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.25 </b>The auditor should disclaim an opinion on the financial statements
in accordance with section 705 or withdraw from the engagement if (Ref: par.
.A32-.A33)
<ol type="a">
	<li>the auditor concludes that sufficient doubt exists about the integrity
of management such that the written representations required
by paragraphs .10-.11 are not reliable or</li>
<li>management does not provide the written representations required
by paragraphs .10-.11.</li>

</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Requested Written Representations Not Provided</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.26 </b>If management does not provide one or more of the requested written
representations, the auditor should
<ol type="a">
	<li>discuss the matter with management;</li>
	<li>reevaluate the integrity of management and evaluate the effect
that this may have on the reliability of representations (oral or
written) and audit evidence in general; and</li>
<li>take appropriate actions, including determining the possible effect
on the opinion in the auditor's report in accordance with section

<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written Representations as Audit Evidence (Ref: par. .03)</b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A1 </b>Written representations are an important source of audit evidence. If
management modifies or does not provide the requested written representations,
it may alert the auditor to the possibility that one or more significant
issues may exist. Further, a request for written rather than oral representations,
in many cases, may prompt management to consider such matters more
rigorously, thereby enhancing the quality of the representations.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management From Whom Written Representations</b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Are Requested (Ref: par. .09)</b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A2 </b>Written representations are requested from those with overall responsibility
for financial and operating matters whom the auditor believes are responsible
for, and knowledgeable about, directly or through others in the organization,
the matters covered by the representations, including the preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements. Those individuals may vary
depending on the governance structure of the entity; however, management
(rather than those charged with governance) is often the responsible party.
Written representations may therefore be requested from the entity's chief executive
officer and chief financial officer or other equivalent persons in entities
that do not use such titles. In some circumstances, however, other parties, such
as those charged with governance, also are responsible for the preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A3 </b>Due to its responsibility for the preparation and fair presentation of
the financial statements and its responsibility for the conduct of the entity's
business, management would be expected to have sufficient knowledge of the
process followed by the entity in preparing the financial statements and the
assertions therein on which to base the written representations.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A4</b>In some cases, however, management may decide to make inquiries
of others who participate in preparing the financial statements and assertions
therein, including individuals who have specialized knowledge relating to the
matters about which written representations are requested. Such individuals
may include the following:
<ul>
	<li>An actuary responsible for actuarially determined accounting
measurements</li>
<li>Staff engineers who may have responsibility for environmental
liability measurements</li>
<li>Internal counsel who may provide information essential to provisions
for legal claims</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A5</b>To reinforce the need for management to make informed representations,
the auditor may request that management include in the written representations
confirmation that it has made such inquiries as it considered appropriate
to place it in the position to be able to make the requested written
representations. It is not expected that such inquiries would usually require a
formal internal process beyond those already established by the entity</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A6</b>In some cases, management may include in the written representations
qualifying language to the effect that representations are made to the
best of its knowledge and belief. It is reasonable for the auditor to accept such
wording if, in the auditor's professional judgment, the representations are being
made by those with appropriate responsibilities and knowledge of the matters
included in the representations.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written Representations About Managements Responsibilities</b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Ref: par. .10-.11)
</b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A7</b>Audit evidence obtained during the audit that management has fulfilled
the responsibilities referred to in paragraphs .10-.11 is not sufficient
without obtaining confirmation from management that it believes that it has
fulfilled those responsibilities. This is because the auditor is not able to judge
solely on other audit evidence whether management has prepared and fairly presented the financial statements and provided information to the auditor
on the basis of the agreed acknowledgment and understanding of its responsibilities.
For example, the auditor could not conclude that management has
provided the auditor with all relevant information agreed upon in the terms
of the audit engagement without asking management whether, and receiving
confirmation that, such information has been provided.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A8</b>The written representations required by paragraphs .10-.11 draw on
the agreed acknowledgment and understanding of management of its responsibilities
in the terms of the audit engagement by requesting confirmation that it
has fulfilled them. In addition to requesting management to confirm that it has
fulfilled its responsibilities, the auditor also may ask management to reconfirm
its acknowledgment and understanding of those responsibilities in written representations.
This is common but, in any event, may be particularly appropriate
when
<ul>
	<li>those who signed the terms of the audit engagement on behalf of
the entity no longer have the relevant responsibilities,</li>
<li>the terms of the audit engagement were prepared in a previous
year,</li>
<li>any indication exists that management misunderstands those responsibilities,
or</li>
<li>changes in circumstances make it appropriate to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consistent with the requirement of section 210, Terms of Engagement, such
reconfirmation of management's acknowledgment and understanding of its responsibilities
is unconditional and is not made subject to the best of management's
knowledge and belief (as discussed in paragraph .A6 of this section).</p>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A9</b>Relevant information may include such matters as the following:
<ul>
	<li>Completeness and availability of all minutes of meetings of stockholders,
directors, and committees of directors or summaries of
actions of recent meetings for which minutes have not yet been
prepared</li>
<li>Communications from regulatory agencies concerning noncompliance
with, or deficiencies in, financial reporting practices</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Considerations Specific to Governmental Entities</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A10</b>The legal or regulatory requirements for audits of the financial statements
of governmental entities may be broader than those of other entities. As
a result, the premise, relating to management's responsibilities, on which an
audit of the financial statements of a governmental entity is conducted may
give rise to additional written representations. These may include written representations
confirming that transactions and events have been carried out in
accordance with applicable law or regulation.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Written Representations</b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Other Written Representations</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A11</b>The written representations relating to fraud required by paragraph
.12 are important for the auditor to obtain, regardless of the size of the entity,
because of the nature of fraud and the difficulties encountered by auditors in
detecting material misstatements in the financial statements resulting from
fraud.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Uncorrected Misstatements (Ref: par. .14)</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A12</b>Because the preparation of the financial statements requires management
to adjust the financial statements to correct material misstatements,
the auditor is required to request management to provide a written representation
about uncorrected misstatements. In some circumstances, management
may not believe that certain uncorrected misstatements are misstatements.
For that reason, management may want to add to their written representation
words such as "We do not agree that items . . . and . . . constitute misstatements
because [description of reasons]." Obtaining this representation does not, however,
relieve the auditor of the need to form a conclusion on the effect of uncorrected
misstatements in accordance with section 450, Evaluation of Misstatements
Identified During the Audit.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Estimates (Ref: par. .16)</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A13</b>Depending on the nature, materiality, and extent of estimation uncertainty,
written representations about accounting estimates recognized or disclosed
in the financial statements may include representations
<ul>
	<li>about the appropriateness of the measurement processes, including
related assumptions and models, used by management in determining
accounting estimates in the context of the applicable
financial reporting framework and the consistency in the application
of the processes.</li>
<li>that the assumptions appropriately reflect management's intent
and ability to carry out specific courses of action on behalf of the
entity when relevant to the accounting estimates and disclosures</li>
<li>that disclosures related to accounting estimates are complete and
appropriate under the applicable financial reporting framework.</li>
<li>that no subsequent event has occurred that would require adjustment
to the accounting estimates and disclosures included in the
financial statements.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A14</b>For those accounting estimates not recognized or disclosed in the financial
statements, written representations also may include representations
about the following:
<ul>
	<li>The appropriateness of the basis used by management for determining
that the criteria of the applicable financial reporting
framework for recognition or disclosure have not been met</li>
<li>The appropriateness of the basis used by management to overcome
a presumption relating to the use of fair value set forth under
the entity's applicable financial reporting framework for those
accounting estimates not measured or disclosed at fair value</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Related Parties (Ref: par. .17)</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A15</b>Circumstances in which it may be appropriate to obtain written representations
about related parties from those charged with governance in addition
to management include the following:
<ul>
	<li>When they have approved specific related party transactions that
(a) materially affect the financial statements or (b) involve management</li>
<li>When they have made specific oral representations to the auditor
on details of certain related party transactions</li>
<li>When they have financial or other interests in the related parties
or the related party transactions</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A16</b>The auditor also may decide to obtain written representations regarding
specific assertions that management may have made, such as a representation
that specific related party transactions do not involve undisclosed
side agreements.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Subsequent Events (Ref: par. .18)</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A17</b>Section 560, Subsequent Events and Subsequently Discovered Facts,
addresses circumstances when the auditor includes an additional date on the
auditor's report (that is, dual-dates the auditor's report for a revision relating to
a subsequent event).5 In such circumstances, the auditor may determine that
obtaining additional representations relating to the subsequent event is appropriate.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Additional Written Representations About the Financial Statements</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>(Ref: par. .19)</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A18</b>In addition to the written representations required by paragraphs
.10-.18, the auditor may consider it necessary to request other written representations
about the financial statements. Such written representations may
supplement, but do not form part of, the written representations required by
paragraphs .10-.18. They may include representations about the following:
<ul>
	<li>Whether the selection and application of accounting policies are
appropriate</li>
<li>Whether matters such as the following, when relevant under the
applicable financial reporting framework, have been recognized,
measured, presented, or disclosed in accordance with that framework:</li>
<ul type="-">
	<li>Plans or intentions that may affect the carrying value or
classification of assets and liabilities</li>
<li> Liabilities, both actual and contingent</li>
<li> Title to, or control over, assets and the liens or encumbrances
on assets and assets pledged as collateral</li>
</ul>
<li>Aspects of laws, regulations, and contractual agreements that may
affect the financial statements, including noncompliance</li>
</ul>
<p>Exhibit B, "Illustrative Specific Written Representations," contains illustrations
of additional representations that may be appropriate in certain situations.</p>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Additional Written Representations About Information Provided
to the Auditor</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A19</b>In addition to the written representation required by paragraph .11,
the auditor may consider it necessary to request management to provide a written
representation that it has communicated to the auditor all deficiencies in
internal control of which management is aware.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Written Representations About Specific Assertions</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A20</b>When obtaining evidence about or evaluating judgments and intentions,
the auditor may consider one or more of the following:
<ul>
	<li>The entity's past history in carrying out its stated intentions</li>
	<li>The entity's reasons for choosing a particular course of action</li>
	<li>The entity's ability to pursue a specific course of action</li>
	<li>The existence, or lack thereof, of any other information obtained
during the course of the audit that may be inconsistent with management's
judgment or intent</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A21</b>In addition, the auditor may consider it necessary to request management
to provide written representations about specific assertions in the financial
statements; in particular, to support an understanding that the auditor
has obtained from other audit evidence of management's judgment or intent regarding,
or the completeness of, a specific assertion. For example, if the intent
of management is important to the valuation basis for investments, it may not
be possible to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence without a written
representation from management about its intentions. Although such written
representations provide necessary audit evidence, they do not provide sufficient
appropriate audit evidence on their own for that assertion</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Communicating a Threshold Amount (Ref: par. .10-.11 and .19)</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A22</b>Management's representations may be limited to matters that are
considered either individually or collectively material to the financial statements,
provided management and the auditor have reached an understanding
on materiality for this purpose. Materiality may be different for different representations.
A discussion of materiality may be included explicitly in the representation
letter in either qualitative or quantitative terms. Materiality considerations
do not apply to those representations that are not directly related
to amounts included in the financial statements (for example, management's
representations about the premise underlying the audit). In addition, because
of the possible effects of fraud on other aspects of the audit, materiality would
not apply to management's acknowledgment regarding its responsibility for the
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control to prevent and detect
fraud.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Date of, and Period(s) Covered by, Written Representations
(Ref: par. .20)
</b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A23</b>Because written representations are necessary audit evidence, the
auditor's opinion cannot be expressed, and the auditor's report cannot be dated,
before the date of the written representations. Furthermore, because the auditor
is concerned with events occurring up to the date of the auditor's report
that may require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the financial statements, the
written representations are dated as of the date of the auditor's report on the
financial statements.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A24</b>In some circumstances, it may be appropriate for the auditor to obtain
a written representation about a specific assertion in the financial statements
during the course of the audit. When this is the case, it may be necessary to
request an updated written representation.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A25</b>The written representations cover all periods referred to in the auditor's
report because management needs to reaffirm that the written representations
it previously made with respect to the prior periods remain appropriate. The auditor and management may agree to a form of written representation
that updates written representations relating to the prior periods by addressing
whether there are any changes to such written representations and, if so,
what they are.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A26</b>Situations may arise in which current management was not present
during all periods referred to in the auditor's report. Such persons may assert
that they are not in a position to provide some or all of the written representations
because they were not in place during the period. This fact, however,
does not diminish such persons' responsibilities for the financial statements
as a whole. Accordingly, the requirement for the auditor to request from
them written representations that cover the whole of the relevant period(s) still
applies.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Form of Written Representations (Ref: par. .21)</b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A27</b>Occasionally, circumstances may prevent management from signing
the representation letter and returning it to the auditor on the date of the auditor's
report. In those circumstances, the auditor may accept management's oral
confirmation, on or before the date of the auditor's report, that management
has reviewed the final representation letter and will sign the representation
letter without exception as of the date of the auditor's report thereby providing
sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the auditor to date the report. However,
possession of the signed management representation letter prior to releasing
the auditor's report is necessary because paragraph .21 requires that
the representations be in the form of a written letter from management. Furthermore,
when there are delays in releasing the report, a fact may become
known to the auditor that, had it been known to the auditor at the date of the
auditor's report, might affect the auditor's report and result in the need for updated
representations. Section 560 addresses the auditor's responsibilities in
such circumstances.</div>

<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A29</b>Section 260, The Auditor's Communication With Those Charged With
Governance, requires the auditor to communicate with those charged with
governance the written representations that the auditor has requested from
management.6</div>

<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Doubt About the Reliability of Written Representations (Ref: par. .22-.23)</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A30</b>Concerns about the competence, integrity, ethical values, or diligence
of management or about its commitment to, or enforcement of, these may cause
the auditor to conclude that the risk of management misrepresentation in the
financial statements is such that an audit cannot be conducted. In such a case,
the auditor may consider withdrawing from the engagement, when withdrawal is possible under applicable law or regulation, unless those charged with governance
put in place appropriate corrective measures. Such measures, however,
may not be sufficient to enable the auditor to issue an unmodified audit opinion</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A31</b>In the case of identified inconsistencies between one or more written
representations and audit evidence obtained from another source, the auditor
may consider whether the risk assessment remains appropriate and, if not,
may revise the risk assessment and determine the nature, timing, and extent
of further audit procedures to respond to the assessed risks.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Written Representations About Managements Responsibilities</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>(Ref: par. .25)</i></b></div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A32</b>As explained in paragraph .A7, the auditor is not able to judge solely
on other audit evidence whether management has fulfilled the responsibilities
referred to in paragraphs .10-.11. Therefore, if, as described in paragraph .25a,
the auditor concludes that the written representations about these matters are
unreliable or if management does not provide those written representations,
the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence. The possible
effects on the financial statements of such inability are not confined to
specific elements, accounts, or items of the financial statements and are hence
pervasive. Section 705 requires the auditor to disclaim an opinion on the financial
statements in such circumstances.7</div>

<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A33</b>3 A written representation that has been modified from that requested
by the auditor does not necessarily mean that management did not provide the
written representation. However, the underlying reason for such modification
may affect the opinion in the auditor's report. For example
<ul>
	<li>the written representation about management's fulfillment of its
responsibility for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements may state that management believes that, except
for material noncompliance with a particular requirement of
the applicable financial reporting framework, the financial statements
are prepared and fairly presented in accordance with that
framework. The requirement in paragraph .25 does not apply because
the auditor concluded that management has provided reliable
written representations. However, the auditor is required
to consider the effect of the noncompliance on the opinion in the
auditor's report in accordance with section 705.</li>
	<li>the written representation about the responsibility of management
to provide the auditor with all relevant information agreed
upon in the terms of the audit engagement may state that management
believes that, except for information destroyed in a fire, it
has provided the auditor with such information. The requirement
in paragraph .25 does not apply because the auditor concluded
that management has provided reliable written representations.
However, the auditor is required to consider the effects of the pervasiveness
of the information destroyed in the fire on the financial
statements and the effect thereof on the opinion in the auditor's
report in accordance with section 705.</li>
</ul>

<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A34</b>Management's refusal to furnish written representations constitutes
a limitation on the scope of the audit. Such refusal is often sufficient to preclude an unmodified opinion and, in particular with respect to the representations
in paragraphs .12–.18, may cause an auditor to disclaim an opinion or withdraw
from the engagement when withdrawal is possible under applicable law
or regulation. However, based on the nature of the representations not obtained
or the circumstances of the refusal, the auditor may conclude that a qualified
opinion is appropriate.</div>
