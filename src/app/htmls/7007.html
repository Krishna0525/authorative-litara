<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement on Standards for Tax
Services No. 7, Form and Content
of Advice to Taxpayers</b>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. </b>This statement sets forth the applicable standards for members
concerning certain aspects of providing advice to a taxpayer and
considers the circumstances in which a member has a responsibility to
communicate with a taxpayer when subsequent developments affect
advice previously provided. The statement does not, however, cover
a members responsibilities when the expectation is that the advice
rendered is likely to be relied on by parties other than the taxpayer.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. </b>A member should use professional judgment to ensure that
tax advice provided to a taxpayer reflects competence and appropriately
serves the taxpayers needs. When communicating tax advice to
a taxpayer in writing, a member should comply with relevant taxing
authorities standards, if any, applicable to written tax advice. A member
should use professional judgment about any need to document
oral advice. A member is not required to follow a standard format
when communicating or documenting oral advice.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. </b>A member should assume that tax advice provided to a taxpayer
will affect the manner in which the matters or transactions considered
would be reported or disclosed on the taxpayers tax returns.
Therefore, for tax advice given to a taxpayer, a member should consider,
when relevant (a) return reporting and disclosure standards applicable
to the related tax return position and (b) the potential penalty
consequences of the return position. In ascertaining applicable return
reporting and disclosure standards, a member should follow the standards
in Statement on Standards for Tax Services No. 1, Tax Return
Positions.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. </b>A member has no obligation to communicate with a taxpayer
when subsequent developments affect advice previously provided with respect to significant matters, except while assisting a taxpayer in
implementing procedures or plans associated with the advice provided
or when a member undertakes this obligation by specific agreement.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. </b>Tax advice is recognized as a valuable service provided by
members. The form of advice may be oral or written and the subject
matter may range from routine to complex. Because the range
of advice is so extensive and because advice should meet the specific
needs of a taxpayer, neither a standard format nor guidelines for communicating
or documenting advice to the taxpayer can be established
to cover all situations.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. </b>Although oral advice may serve a taxpayers needs appropriately
in routine matters or in well-defined areas, written communications
are recommended in important, unusual, substantial dollar
value, or complicated transactions. The member may use professional
judgment about whether, subsequently, to document oral advice.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7. </b>In deciding on the form of advice provided to a taxpayer, a
member should exercise professional judgment and should consider
such factors as the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The importance of the transaction and amounts involved</li>
	<li>The specific or general nature of the taxpayers inquiry</li>
	<li>The time available for development and submission of the
advice</li>
	<li>The technical complexity involved</li>
	<li>The existence of authorities and precedents</li>
	<li>The tax sophistication of the taxpayer</li>
	<li>The need to seek other professional advice</li>
	<li>The type of transaction and whether it is subject to heightened
reporting or disclosure requirements</li>
	<li>The potential penalty consequences of the tax return position
for which the advice is rendered</li>
	<li>Whether any potential applicable penalties can be avoided
through disclosure</li>
	<li>Whether the member intends for the taxpayer to rely upon
the advice to avoid potential penalties</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">8. </b>A member may assist a taxpayer in implementing procedures
or plans associated with the advice offered. When providing such assistance,
the member should review and revise such advice as warranted
by new developments and factors affecting the transaction.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">9. </b>Sometimes a member is requested to provide tax advice but
does not assist in implementing the plans adopted. Although such
developments as legislative or administrative changes or future judicial
interpretations may affect the advice previously provided, a member
cannot be expected to communicate subsequent developments
that affect such advice unless the member undertakes this obligation
by specific agreement with the taxpayer.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10. </b>Taxpayers should be informed that (a) the advice reflects professional
judgment based upon the members understanding of the
facts, and the law existing as of the date the advice is rendered and
(b) subsequent developments could affect previously rendered professional
advice. Members may use precautionary language to the effect
that their advice is based on facts as stated and authorities that are
subject to change.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. </b>	 In providing tax advice, a member should be cognizant of
applicable confidentiality privileges.
