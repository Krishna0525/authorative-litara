<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-6</b>  A creditor needs to apply judgment based on individual facts and circumstances to determine what represents large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans.  Paragraphs 310-10-35-7 through 35-11 would apply to those groups of smaller-balance loans as well as loans that are not identified for evaluation or that are evaluated but are not individually considered impaired.</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;&gt;  Losses from Uncollectible Receivables</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-7</b>  The conditions under which receivables exist usually involve some degree of uncertainty about their collectibility, in which case a contingency exists.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-8</b>  Subtopic 450-20 requires recognition of a loss when both of the following conditions are met:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Information available before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25) indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired at the date of the financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-9</b>  Losses from uncollectible receivables shall be accrued when both of the preceding conditions are met.  Those conditions may be considered in relation to individual receivables or in relation to groups of similar types of receivables.  If the conditions are met, accrual shall be made even though the particular receivables that are uncollectible may not be identifiable.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-10</b>  If, based on current information and events, it is probable that the entity will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the receivable, the condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(a) is met.  As used here, all amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest payments and the contractual principal payments will be collected as scheduled according to the receivable's contractual terms.  However, a creditor need not consider an insignificant delay or insignificant shortfall in amount of payments as meeting the condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(a).  Whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated (the condition in paragraph 450-20-25-2(b)) will normally depend on, among other things, the experience of the entity, information about the ability of individual debtors to pay, and appraisal of the receivables in light of the current economic environment.  In the case of an entity that has no experience of its own, reference to the experience of other entities in the same business may be appropriate.
