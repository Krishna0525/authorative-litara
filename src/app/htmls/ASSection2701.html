</p>
<p id="sec-0001" class="section">
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.01</b> This standard sets forth the auditor's responsibilities when the auditor of the company's financial statements is engaged to perform audit procedures and report on <b>supplemental information<sup>1</sup></b> that accompanies financial statements<sup>2</sup> audited pursuant to Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“ PCAOB”) standards.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Objective</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.02</b> The objective of the auditor of the financial statements, when engaged to perform audit procedures and report on supplemental information that accompanies audited financial statements, is to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to express an opinion on whether the supplemental information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Performing Audit Procedures on Supplemental Information Accompanying Audited Financial Statements</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.03</b> The auditor should perform audit procedures to obtain appropriate audit evidence that is sufficient to support the auditor's opinion regarding whether the supplemental information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole. The nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures necessary to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence and to report on the supplemental information depends on, among other things:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. The risk of material misstatement of the supplemental information;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. The materiality considerations relevant to the information presented;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> When planning and performing the audit procedures to report on supplemental information, the auditor generally should use the same materiality considerations as those used in planning and performing the audit of the financial statements.<sup>3</sup> However, if applicable regulatory requirements specify a lower materiality level to be applied to certain supplemental information, the auditor should use those prescribed threshold requirements in planning and performing audit procedures for the supplemental information.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. The evidence obtained from the audit of the financial statements and, if applicable, other engagements by the auditor or affiliates of the firm,<sup>4</sup> for the period presented; and
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> The procedures performed regarding the supplemental information should be planned and performed in conjunction with the audit of the financial statements. For audits of brokers and dealers, the procedures should be coordinated with the attestation engagements related to compliance or exemption reports required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“ SEC”).<sup>5</sup> The auditor should take into account relevant evidence from the audit of the financial statements and, for audits of brokers or dealers, the attestation engagements, in planning and performing audit procedures related to the supplemental information and in evaluating the results of the audit procedures to form the opinion on the supplemental information.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. Whether a qualified opinion, an adverse opinion, or a disclaimer of opinion was issued on the financial statements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.04</b> In performing the audit procedures on supplemental information, the auditor should:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. Obtain an understanding of the purpose of the supplemental information and the criteria management used to prepare the supplemental information, including relevant regulatory requirements;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. Obtain an understanding of the methods of preparing the supplemental information, evaluate the appropriateness of those methods, and determine whether those methods have changed from the methods used in the prior period and, if the methods have changed, determine the reasons for and evaluate the appropriateness of such changes;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. Inquire of management about any significant assumptions or interpretations underlying the measurement or presentation of the supplemental information;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. Determine that the supplemental information reconciles to the underlying accounting and other records or to the financial statements, as applicable;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">e. Perform procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information presented in the supplemental information to the extent that it was not tested as part of the audit of financial statements; and</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">f. Evaluate whether the supplemental information, including its form and content, complies with relevant regulatory requirements or other applicable criteria, if any.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Management Representations</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.05</b> The auditor should obtain written representations from management, including:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. A statement that management acknowledges its responsibility for the fair presentation of the supplemental information and, if applicable, the form and content of that supplemental information, in conformity with relevant regulatory requirements or other applicable criteria;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. A statement that management believes the supplemental information, including its form and content, is fairly stated, in all material respects;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. A statement that the methods of measurement or presentation have not changed from those used in the prior period or, if the methods of measurement or presentation have changed, the reasons for such changes and why those changes are appropriate;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. If the form and content of the supplemental information is prescribed by regulatory requirements or other applicable criteria, a statement that the supplemental information complies, in all material respects, with the regulatory requirements or other applicable criteria, and identification of those requirements or other applicable criteria; and</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">e. A description of any significant assumptions or interpretations underlying the measurement or presentation of the supplemental information, and a statement that management believes that such assumptions or interpretations are appropriate.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Evaluation of Audit Results</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.06</b> To form an opinion on the supplemental information, the auditor should evaluate whether the supplemental information, including its form and content, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole, including whether the supplemental information is presented in conformity, in all material respects, with the relevant regulatory requirements or other applicable criteria.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.07</b> The auditor should accumulate misstatements regarding the supplemental information identified during performance of audit procedures on the supplemental information and in the audit of the financial statements.<sup>6</sup> The auditor should communicate accumulated misstatements regarding the supplemental information to management on a timely basis to provide management with an opportunity to correct them.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">08. The auditor should evaluate whether uncorrected misstatements related to the supplemental information are material, either individually or in combination with other misstatements, taking into account relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> The auditor should evaluate the effect of uncorrected misstatements related to the supplemental information in evaluating the results of the financial statement audit.<sup>7</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.09</b> The auditor should evaluate the effect of any modifications to the audit report on the financial statements when forming an opinion on the supplemental information:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. When the auditor expresses a qualified opinion on the financial statements and the basis for the qualification also applies to the supplemental information, the auditor should describe the effects of the qualification on the supplemental information in the report on supplemental information and should express a qualified opinion on the supplemental information.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. When the auditor expresses an adverse opinion, or disclaims an opinion on the financial statements, the auditor should express an adverse opinion, or disclaim an opinion, on the supplemental information, whichever is appropriate.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Reporting</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.10</b> The auditor's report on supplemental information accompanying audited financial statements should include the following:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. Identification of the supplemental information.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> Identification may be by descriptive title of the supplemental information or reference to the page number and document where the supplemental information is located.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. A statement that the supplemental information is the responsibility of management.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. A statement that the supplemental information has been subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audit of the financial statements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> If the financial statements are presented in a separate document from the supplemental information or otherwise are not readily identifiable to the user of the supplemental information, the auditor's report on supplemental information should identify the document containing the company's financial statements.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. A statement that the audit procedures performed included determining whether the supplemental information reconciles to the financial statements or the underlying accounting and other records, as applicable, and performing procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information presented in the supplemental information.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">e. A statement that in forming the auditor's opinion, the auditor evaluated whether supplemental information, including its form and content, complies, in all material respects, with the specified regulatory requirements or other criteria, if applicable.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">f. A statement, if applicable, that the supplemental information is presented on a basis that differs from the financial statements and is not prescribed by regulatory requirements. When such a statement is made, the report should describe the basis for the supplemental information presentation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">g. An opinion on whether the supplemental information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole, or a disclaimer of opinion.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.11</b> Unless prescribed by regulatory requirements, the auditor may either include the auditor's report on the supplemental information in the auditor's report on the financial statements or issue a separate report on the supplemental information. If the auditor issues a separate report on the supplemental information, that report should identify the auditor's report on the financial statements.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.12</b> The date of the auditor's report on the supplemental information in relation to the financial statements as a whole should not be earlier than:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. The date of the auditor's report on the financial statements from which the supplemental information was derived, and</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. The date on which the auditor obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the auditor's opinion on the supplemental information in relation to the financial statements as a whole.<sup>8</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.13</b> The following is an example of an auditor's report on supplemental information when included in the auditor's report on the financial statements:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">The [identify supplemental information] has been subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audit of [Company's] financial statements. The [supplemental information] is the responsibility of the Company's management. Our audit procedures included determining whether the [supplemental information] reconciles to the financial statements or the underlying accounting and other records, as applicable, and performing procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information presented in the [supplemental information]. In forming our opinion on the [supplemental information], we evaluated whether the [supplemental information], including its form and content, is presented in conformity with [specify the relevant regulatory requirement or other criteria, if any]. In our opinion, the [identify supplemental information] is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.14</b> If the auditor determines that the supplemental information is materially misstated in relation to the financial statements as a whole, the auditor should describe the material misstatement in the auditor's report on the supplemental information and express a qualified or adverse opinion on the supplemental information.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.15</b> If the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on the supplemental information, the auditor should disclaim an opinion on the supplemental information. In those situations, the auditor's report on the supplemental information should describe the reason for the disclaimer and state that the auditor is unable to and does not express an opinion on the supplemental information.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> If the supplemental information consists of two or more schedules, and the auditor is able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on some but not all schedules, the auditor may express an opinion on only those schedules for which he or she obtained sufficient appropriate evidence but should disclaim an opinion on the other schedules.
      </p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><sup>1</sup> Terms defined in Appendix A, Definitions, are set in <b>boldface type</b> the first time they appear.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. For purposes of this standard, supplemental information “accompanies financial statements” when it is (1) presented in the same document as the audited financial statements, (2) presented in a document in which the audited financial statements are incorporated by reference, or (3) incorporated by reference in a document containing the audited financial statements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">3. AS 2105, <em>Consideration of Materiality in Planning and Performing an Audit</em>, establishes requirements regarding the auditor's consideration of materiality in planning and performing an audit.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">4. The term “affiliates of the firm” as used in this standard has the same meaning as the term “affiliates of the accounting firm” as defined in PCAOB Rule 3501.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">5. <em>See</em> Attestation Standard No. 1, <em>Examination Engagements Regarding Compliance Reports of Brokers and Dealers</em>, and Attestation Standard No. 2, <em>Review Engagements Regarding Exemption Reports of Brokers and Dealers</em>.
