      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>General</b></p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>45-1</b> When either party to a contract has performed, an entity shall present the contract in the statement of financial position as a contract asset or a contract liability, depending on the relationship between the entity’s performance and the customer’s payment. An entity shall present any unconditional rights to consideration separately as a receivable.
      </p>

      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>45-2</b> If a customer pays consideration, or an entity has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (that is, a receivable), before the entity transfers a good or service to the customer, the entity shall present the contract as a contract liability when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). A contract liability is an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer.
      </p>

      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>45-3</b> If an entity performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, the entity shall present the contract as a contract asset, excluding any amounts presented as a receivable. A contract asset is an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer. An entity shall assess a contract asset for impairment in accordance with Topic 310 on receivables. An impairment of a contract asset shall be measured, presented, and disclosed in accordance with Topic 310 (see also paragraph 606-10-50-4(b))
      </p>

      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>45-4</b> A receivable is an entity’s right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. For example, an entity would recognize a receivable if it has a present right to payment even though that amount may be subject to refund in the future. An entity shall account for a receivable in accordance with Topic 310. Upon initial recognition of a receivable from a contract with a customer, any difference between the measurement of the receivable in accordance with Topic 310 and the corresponding amount of revenue recognized shall be presented as an expense (for example, as an impairment loss).
      </p>

      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>45-5</b> This guidance uses the terms contract asset and contract liability but does not prohibit an entity from using alternative descriptions in the statement of financial position for those items. If an entity uses an alternative description for a contract asset, the entity shall provide sufficient information for a user of the financial statements to distinguish between receivables and contract assets.
