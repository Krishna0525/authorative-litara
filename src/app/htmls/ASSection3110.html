<p id="sec-0001" class="section">
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.01</b> The auditor should date the audit report no earlier than the date on which the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate evidence to support the auditor's opinion. Paragraph .05 describes the procedure to be followed when a subsequent event occurring after the report date is disclosed in the financial statements.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> When performing an integrated audit of financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, the auditor's reports on the company's financial statements and on internal control over financial reporting should be dated the same date.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Note:</b> If the auditor concludes that a scope limitation will prevent the auditor from obtaining the reasonable assurance necessary to express an opinion on the financial statements, then the auditor's report date is the date that the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate evidence to support the representations in the auditor's report.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.02</b> The auditor has no responsibility to make any inquiry or carry out any auditing procedures for the period after the date of his report.<sup>1</sup> However, with respect to filings under the Securities Act of 1933, reference should be made to paragraphs .10-.13 of AS 4101, <em>Responsibilities Regarding Filings Under Federal Securities Statutes</em>.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Events Occurring After the Date of the Independent Auditor's Report But Before Issuance of Report</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.03</b> In case a subsequent event of the type requiring adjustment of the financial statements (as discussed in paragraph .03 of AS 2801, <em>Subsequent Events</em>) occurs after the date of the independent auditor's report but before the issuance of the related financial statements, and the event comes to the attention of the auditor, the financial statements should be adjusted or the auditor should qualify his or her opinion.<sup>2</sup> When the adjustment is made without disclosure of the event, the report ordinarily should be dated in accordance with paragraph .01. However, if the financial statements are adjusted and disclosure of the event is made, or if no adjustment is made and the auditor qualifies his or her opinion,<sup>3</sup> the procedures set forth in paragraph .05 should be followed.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.04</b> In case a subsequent event of the type requiring disclosure (as discussed in AS 2801.05) occurs after the date of the auditor's report but before the issuance of the related financial statements, and the event comes to the attention of the auditor, it should be disclosed in a note to the financial statements or the auditor should qualify his or her opinion.<sup>4</sup> If disclosure of the event is made, either in a note or in the auditor's report, the auditor would date the report as set forth in the following paragraph.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.05</b> The independent auditor has two methods for dating the report when a subsequent event disclosed in the financial statements occurs after the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate evidence on which to base his or her opinion, but before the issuance of the related financial statements. The auditor may use “dual dating,” for example, “February 16, 20__, except for Note __, as to which the date is March 1, 20__,” or may date the report as of the later date. In the former instance, the responsibility for events occurring subsequent to the original report date is limited to the specific event referred to in the note (or otherwise disclosed). In the latter instance, the independent auditor's responsibility for subsequent events extends to the later report date and, accordingly, the procedures outlined in AS 2801.12 generally should be extended to that date.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Reissuance of the Independent Auditor's Report</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.06</b> An independent auditor may reissue his report on financial statements contained in annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory agencies or in a document he submits to his client or to others that contains information in addition to the client's basic financial statements subsequent to the date of his original report on the basic financial statements. An independent auditor may also be requested by his client to furnish additional copies of a previously issued report. Use of the original report date in a reissued report removes any implication that records, transactions, or events after that date have been examined or reviewed. In such cases, the independent auditor has no responsibility to make further investigation or inquiry as to events which may have occurred during the period between the original report date and the date of the release of additional reports. However, see AS 4101 as to an auditor's responsibility when his report is included in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 and see paragraphs .70-.73 of AS 3101, <em>Reports on Audited Financial Statements</em>, for the predecessor auditor's responsibility when reissuing or consenting to the reuse of a report previously issued on the financial statements of a prior period.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.07</b> In some cases, it may not be desirable for the independent auditor to reissue his report in the circumstances described in paragraph .06 because he has become aware of an event that occurred subsequent to the date of his original report that requires adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements. In such cases, adjustment with disclosure or disclosure alone should be made as described in AS 2801.08. The independent auditor should consider the effect of these matters on his opinion and he should date his report in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph .05.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.08</b> However, if an event of the type requiring disclosure only (as discussed in AS 2801.05 and AS 2801.08) occurs between the date of the independent auditor's original report and the date of the reissuance of such report, and if the event comes to the attention of the independent auditor, the event may be disclosed in a separate note to the financial statements captioned somewhat as follows:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">Event (Unaudited) Subsequent to the Date of the</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">Independent Auditor's Report</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">Under these circumstances, the report of the independent auditor would carry the same date used in the original report.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">1. <em>See</em> AS 2905, <em>Subsequent Discovery of Facts Existing at the Date of the Auditor's Report</em>, regarding procedures to be followed by the auditor who, subsequent to the date of his report upon audited financial statements, becomes aware that facts may have existed at that date which might have affected his report had he then been aware of such facts.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. In some cases, a disclaimer of opinion or an adverse opinion may be appropriate.</p>
