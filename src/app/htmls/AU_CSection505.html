<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">External Confirmation Procedures to Obtain Audit Evidence</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc50502">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>Section 500 indicates that the reliability of audit evidence is influenced by its source and nature and is dependent on the individual circumstances under which it is obtained.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 1</sup> Section 500 also includes the following generalizations applicable to audit evidence:<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p>

<ul>
<li>

Audit evidence is more reliable when it is obtained from independent sources outside the entity.
</li>

<li>Audit evidence obtained directly by the auditor is more reliable than audit evidence obtained indirectly or by inference.</li>

<li>Audit evidence is more reliable when it exists in documentary form, whether paper, electronic, or other medium.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Accordingly, depending on the circumstances of the audit, audit evidence in the form of external confirmations received directly by the auditor from confirming parties may be more reliable than evidence generated internally by the entity. This section is intended to assist the auditor in designing and performing external confirmation procedures to obtain relevant and reliable audit evidence.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc50503">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03  </b>Other AU-C sections recognize the importance of external confirmations as audit evidence; for example

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>section 330 discusses the auditor's responsibility (a) to design and implement overall responses to address the assessed risks of material misstatement at the financial statement level and (b) to design and perform further audit procedures whose nature, timing, and extent are based on, and are responsive to, the assessed risks of material misstatement at the relevant assertion level.<sup>fn 3</sup> In addition, section 330 requires that, irrespective of the assessed risks of material misstatement, the auditor design and perform substantive procedures for all relevant assertions related to each material class of transactions, account balance, and disclosure.<sup>fn 4</sup> The auditor is required to consider whether external confirmation procedures are to be performed as substantive audit procedures and is required to use external confirmation procedures for accounts receivable unless

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>the overall account balance is immaterial, </li>

<li>external confirmation procedures would be ineffective, or</li>

<li>the auditor's assessed level of risk of material misstatement at the relevant assertion level is low, and the other planned substantive procedures address the assessed risk.<sup>fn 5</sup>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>

<li>section 330 requires that the auditor obtain more persuasive audit evidence the higher the auditor's assessment of risk.<sup>fn 6</sup> To do this, the auditor may increase the quantity of the evidence or obtain evidence that is more relevant or reliable, or both. For example, the auditor may place more emphasis on obtaining evidence directly from third parties or obtaining corroborating evidence from a number of independent sources. Section 330 also indicates that external confirmation procedures may assist the auditor in obtaining audit evidence with the high level of reliability that the auditor requires to respond to significant risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.<sup>fn 7</sup>
</li>

<li>section 240, Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit, indicates that the auditor may design confirmation requests to obtain additional corroborative information as a response to address the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud at the assertion level.<sup>fn 8</sup>
</li>

<li>section 500 indicates that corroborating information obtained from a source independent of the entity (such as external confirmations) may increase the assurance the auditor obtains from evidence existing within the accounting records or representations made by management.<sup>fn 9</sup>
</li>
</ul>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06  </b>For purposes of generally accepted auditing standards, the following terms have the meanings attributed as follows:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exception.  </b>A response that indicates a difference between information requested to be confirmed, or contained in the entity's records, and information provided by the confirming party.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">External confirmation.  </b>Audit evidence obtained as a direct written response to the auditor from a third party (the confirming party), either in paper form or by electronic or other medium (for example, through the auditor's direct access to information held by a third party).

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Negative confirmation request.  </b>A request that the confirming party respond directly to the auditor only if the confirming party disagrees with the information provided in the request.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nonresponse.  </b>A failure of the confirming party to respond, or fully respond, to a positive confirmation request or a confirmation request returned undelivered.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">External Confirmation Procedures</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07</b> When using external confirmation procedures, the auditor should maintain control over external confirmation requests, including</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>
			<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>determining the information to be confirmed or requested; </p>
		</li>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management’s Refusal to Allow the Auditor to Perform External Confirmation Procedures</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08</b> If management refuses to allow the auditor to perform external confirmation procedures, the auditor should</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>
			<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>inquire about management's reasons for the refusal and seek audit evidence about their validity and reasonableness; </p>

		<li>
			<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>perform alternative audit procedures designed to obtain relevant and reliable audit evidence.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09</b> If the auditor concludes that management's refusal to allow the auditor to perform external confirmation procedures is unreasonable or the auditor is unable to obtain relevant and reliable audit evidence from alternative audit procedures, the auditor should communicate with those charged with governance, in accordance with section 260,<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> The Auditor's Communication With Those Charged With Governance.</i ><sup>10</sup> The auditor also should determine the implications for the audit and the auditor's opinion, in accordance with section 705,<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Modifications to the Opinion in the Independent Auditor's Report.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.10</b> If the auditor identifies factors that give rise to doubts about the reliability of the response to a confirmation request, the auditor should obtain further audit evidence to resolve those doubts.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11</b> If the auditor determines that a response to a confirmation request is not reliable, the auditor should evaluate the implications on the assessment of the relevant risks of material misstatement, including the risk of fraud, and on the related nature, timing, and extent of other audit procedures. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Nonresponses and Oral Responses</i></b></p>	

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12</b> In the case of each nonresponse, the auditor should perform alternative audit procedures to obtain relevant and reliable audit evidence. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.13</b> If the auditor has determined that a written response to a positive confirmation request is necessary to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence, alternative audit procedures will not provide the audit evidence the auditor requires. If the auditor does not obtain such confirmation, the auditor should determine the implications for the audit and the auditor's opinion, in accordance with section 705.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Exceptions</i></b></p>	

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.14</b> The auditor should investigate exceptions to determine whether they are indicative of misstatements. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.15</b> Negative confirmations provide less persuasive audit evidence than positive confirmations. Accordingly, the auditor should not use negative confirmation requests as the sole substantive audit procedure to address an assessed risk of material misstatement at the assertion level, unless all of the following are present: </p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>
			<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>The auditor has assessed the risk of material misstatement as low and has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the assertion. </p>

			<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>The population of items subject to negative confirmation procedures comprises a large number of small, homogeneous account balances, transactions, or conditions. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>A very low exception rate is expected.</p>
		</li>
		<li>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16</b> The auditor should evaluate whether the results of the external confirmation procedures provide relevant and reliable audit evidence or whether further audit evidence is necessary</p></p>
