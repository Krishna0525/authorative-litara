<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement on Standards for Tax
Services No. 4, Use of Estimates</b>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. </b>This statement sets forth the applicable standards for members
when using the taxpayers estimates in the preparation of a tax
return. A member may advise on estimates used in the preparation
of a tax return, but the taxpayer has the responsibility to provide the
estimated data. Appraisals or valuations are not considered estimates
for purposes of this statement.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. </b>Unless prohibited by statute or by rule, a member may use the
taxpayers estimates in the preparation of a tax return if it is not practical
to obtain exact data and if the member determines that the estimates
are reasonable based on the facts and circumstances known to
the member. The taxpayers estimates should be presented in a manner
that does not imply greater accuracy than exists.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. </b>Accounting requires the exercise of professional judgment
and, in many instances, the use of approximations based on judgment.
The application of such accounting judgments, as long as not in conflict
with methods set forth by a taxing authority, is acceptable. These
judgments are not estimates within the purview of this statement. For
example, a federal income tax regulation provides that if all other conditions
for accrual are met, the exact amount of income or expense
need not be known or ascertained at year end if the amount can be
determined with reasonable accuracy.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. </b>When the taxpayers records do not accurately reflect information
related to small expenditures, accuracy in recording some data
may be difficult to achieve. Therefore, the use of estimates by a tax payer in determining the amount to be deducted for such items may
be appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. </b>When records are missing or precise information about
a transaction is not available at the time the return must be filed, a
member may prepare a tax return using a taxpayers estimates of the
missing data.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. </b>Estimated amounts should not be presented in a manner that
provides a misleading impression about the degree of factual accuracy
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7. </b>Specific disclosure that an estimate is used for an item in the
return is not generally required; however, such disclosure should be
made in unusual circumstances where nondisclosure might mislead
the taxing authority regarding the degree of accuracy of the return as a
whole. Some examples of unusual circumstances include the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>A taxpayer has died or is ill at the time the return must be
filed.</li>
	<li>A taxpayer has not received a Schedule K-1 for a pass-through
entity at the time the tax return is to be filed.</li>
	<li>There is litigation pending (for example, a bankruptcy proceeding)
that bears on the return.</li>
	<li>Fire, computer failure, or natural disaster has destroyed the
relevant records</li>
</ol>
