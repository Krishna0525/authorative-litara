<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Recognition Section provides guidance on the required criteria, timing, and location (within the financial statements) for recording a particular item in the financial statements. Disclosure is not recognition. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note for Fair Value Option: </b>Some of the items subject to the guidance in this Subtopic may qualify for application of the Fair Value Option Subsections of Subtopic 825-10. Those Subsections (see paragraph 825-10-05-5) address circumstances in which entities may choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the fair value option). See Section 825-10-15 for guidance on the scope of the Fair Value Option Subsections of the Financial Instruments Topic.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Debt Instruments with Detachable Warrants </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-2   </b>Proceeds from the sale of a debt instrument with stock purchase warrants (detachable call options) shall be allocated to the two elements based on the relative <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fair values</b> of the debt instrument without the warrants and of the warrants themselves <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">at time of issuance</b>. The portion of the proceeds so allocated to the warrants shall be accounted for as paid-in capital. The remainder of the proceeds shall be allocated to the debt instrument portion of the transaction. This usually results in a discount (or, occasionally, a reduced premium), which shall be accounted for under Topic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">835.</u> 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-3   </b>The same accounting treatment applies to issues of debt instruments (issued with detachable warrants) that may be surrendered in settlement of the exercise price of the warrant. However, if stock purchase warrants are not detachable from the debt instrument and the debt instrument must be surrendered to exercise the warrant, the two instruments taken together are substantially equivalent to a convertible debt instrument and the accounting specified in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-25-12</u> shall apply. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Beneficial Conversion Features </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-4   </b>The guidance in the following paragraph and paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-25-6</u> applies to all of the following instruments if the instrument is not within the scope of the Cash Conversion Subsections: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Convertible instruments (convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock) with beneficial conversion features that must be settled in stock </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Convertible shares with beneficial conversion features that give the issuer a choice of settling the obligation in either stock or cash </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Instruments with beneficial conversion features that are convertible into multiple instruments, for example, a convertible preferred stock that is convertible into common stock and detachable warrants </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Instruments with conversion features that are not beneficial at the commitment date (see paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-30-9 through 30-12</u>) but that become beneficial upon the occurrence of a future event, such as an initial public offering. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-5   </b>An embedded beneficial conversion feature present in a convertible instrument shall be recognized separately at issuance by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital. Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-30-4</u> provides guidance on measuring intrinsic value that applies to both the determination of whether an embedded conversion feature is beneficial and the allocation of proceeds.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-6   </b>A contingent beneficial conversion feature shall be measured using the commitment date stock price (see paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-30-9 through 30-12</u>) but, as discussed in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-35-3</u>, shall not be recognized in earnings until the contingency is resolved. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-7   </b>For the application of Topic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740</u> to beneficial conversion features that result in basis differences, see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-55-51</u>.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Conversion Features that Reset </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-8   </b>If a convertible instrument has a conversion option that continuously resets as the underlying stock price increases or decreases so as to provide a fixed value of common stock to the holder at any conversion date, the convertible instrument shall be considered stock-settled debt and the contingent beneficial conversion option provisions of this Subtopic would not apply when those resets subsequently occur. However, the guidance in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-25-5</u> applies to the initial recognition of such a convertible instrument, including any initial active beneficial conversion feature. Example 14 (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-55-18</u>) illustrates application of the guidance in this paragraph.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-9   </b>For guidance on a contingent conversion feature that will reduce (reset) the conversion price if the fair value of the underlying stock declines after the commitment date to or below a specified price, see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-20-35-4</u>.
