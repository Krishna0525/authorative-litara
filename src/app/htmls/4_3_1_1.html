<p class="header">&gt;  Classification of Debt that Includes Covenants</p>
</p><p id="47045">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-1</b>  Some long-term loans require compliance with certain covenants that must be met on a quarterly or semiannual basis.  If a covenant violation occurs that would otherwise give the lender the right to call the debt, a lender may waive its call right arising from the current violation for a period greater than one year while retaining future covenant requirements.  Unless facts and circumstances indicate otherwise, the borrower shall classify the obligation as noncurrent, unless both of the following conditions exist:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  A covenant violation that gives the lender the right to call the debt has occurred at the balance sheet date or would have occurred absent a loan modification.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  It is probable that the borrower will not be able to cure the default (comply with the covenant) at measurement dates that are within the next 12 months.
</p>
</p><p>See Example 1 (paragraph 470-10-55-2) for illustration of this classification guidance.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Subjective Acceleration Clauses and Debt Classification</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-2</b>  In some situations, the circumstances (for example, recurring losses or liquidity problems) would indicate that long-term debt subject to a subjective acceleration clause should be classified as a current liability.  Other situations would indicate only disclosure of the existence of such clauses.</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Classification of Revolving Credit Agreements Subject to Lock-Box Arrangements and Subjective Acceleration Clauses</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4</b>  Borrowings outstanding under certain revolving credit agreements are considered long-term debt because the borrowings are due at the end of a specified period (for example, 3 years) rather than when short-term notes roll over (for example, every 90 days).  Borrowings may be collateralized, but the only note is the the overall note signed at the agreement's inception.  Some agreements require that the borrower maintain a lock-box arrangement.  If borrowings outstanding under the agreement are considered long-term obligations, the effect of a subjective acceleration clause on balance sheet classification is determined based on the criteria in paragraph 470-10-45-2.  If borrowings outstanding are considered short-term obligations, and the borrower intends to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis, paragraph 470-1045-13 applies and the debt shall be classified as a current liability because of the existence of the subjective acceleration clause.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-5</b>  Borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit arrangement that includes both a subjective acceleration clause and a requirement to maintain a lock-box arrangement shall be considered short-term obligations.  Accordingly, because of the subjective acceleration clause, the debt shall be classified as a current liability unless the conditions in paragraph 470-10-45-14 are met based on an agreement, other than the revolving credit agreement, to refinance the obligation after the balance sheet date on a long-term basis.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-6</b>  Borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit agreement that includes both a subjective acceleration clause and a requirement to maintain a springing lock-box arrangement shall be considered long-term obligations since the remittances do not automatically reduce the debt outstanding without another event occurring.  The effect of the agreement's subjective acceleration clause shall be determined based on the provisions of paragraph 470-10-45-2.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Classification of Increasing-Rate Debt</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-7</b>  Classification of increasing-rate debt as current or noncurrent would reflect the borrower's anticipated source of repayment that is, current assets or a new short-term debt borrowing versus a long-term refinancing agreement that meets the requirements of this Subtopic and need not be consistent with the time frame used to determine periodic interest cost.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-8</b>  If the debt is paid at par before its estimated maturity, any excess interest accrued shall be an adjustment of interest expense.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Due on Demand Loan Arrangements</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-9</b>  Loan agreements may specify the debtor's repayment terms but also enable the creditor, at his discretion, to demand payment at any time.  Those loan arrangements meay have wording such as either of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  "The term note shall mature in monthly installments as set forth therein or on demand, whichever is earlier."</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">"Principal and interest shall be due on demand, or if no demand is made, in quarterly installments beginning on..."</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-10</b>  The current liability classification shall include obligations that, by their terms, are due on demand or will be due on demand within one year (or operating cycle, if longer) from the balance sheet date, even though liquidation may not be expected within that period.  the demand provision is not a subjective acceleration clause as discussed in paragraph 470-10-45-2.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Callable Debt</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-11</b>  Current liabilities shall include long-term obligations that are or will be callable by the creditor either because the debtor's violation of a provision of the debt agreement at the balance sheet date makes the obligation callable or because the violation, if not cured within a specified grace period, will make the obligation callable.  accordingly, such callable obligations shall be classified as current liabilities unless either of the following conditions is met:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The creditor has waived or subsequently lost (for example, the debtor has cured the violation after the balance sheet date and the obligation is not callable at the time the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued [as discussed in Section 855-10-25]) the right to demand repayment for more than one year (or operating cycle, if longer) from the balance sheet date.  If the obligation is callable because of violations of certain provisions of the debt agreement, the creditor needs to waive its right with regard only to those violations.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  For long-term obligations containing a grace period within which the debtor may cure the violation, it is probable that the violation will be cured within that period, thus preventing the obligation from becoming callable.
</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12</b>  Drawing a distinction between significant violations of critical conditions and technical violations is not practicable.  A violation that a debtor considers to be technical may be considered critical by the creditor.  Furthermore, a creditor may choose to use a technical violation as a means to withdraw from its lending relationship with the debtor.  If the violation is considered insignificant by the creditor, then the debtor should be able to obtain a waiver as discussed in the preceding paragraph.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12A</b>  Some short-term obligations are expected to be refinanced on a long-term basis and, therefore, are not expected to require the use of working capital during the ensuing fiscal year.  Examples include commercial paper, construction loans, and the currently maturing portion of long-term debt.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12B</b>  Refinancing a short-term obligation on a long-term basis means either replacing it with a long-term obligation with equity securities or renewing, extending, or replacing it with short-term obligations for an uninterrupted period extending beyond one year (or the operating cycle, if applicable) from the date of an entity's balance sheet.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-13</b>  Short-term obligations arising from transactions in the normal course of business that are due in customary terms shall be classified as current liabilities. A short-term obligation shall be excluded from current liabilities only if the conditions in the following paragraph are met. Funds obtained on a long-term basis before the balance sheet date would be excluded from current assets if the obligation to be liquidated is excluded from current liabilities.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Intent and Ability to Refinance on a Long-Term Basis</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-14</b>  A short-term obligation shall be excluded from current liabilities if the entity intends to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-10-05-7</u>) and the intent to refinance the short-term obligation on a long-term basis is supported by an ability to consummate the refinancing demonstrated in either of the following ways:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Post-balance-sheet-date issuance of a long-term obligation or equity securities. After the date of an entity's balance sheet but before that balance sheet is issued or is available to be issued (as discussed in Section <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">855-10-25</u>), a long-term obligation or equity securities have been issued for the purpose of refinancing the short-term obligation on a long-term basis. If equity securities have been issued, the short-term obligation, although excluded from current liabilities, shall not be included in owners' equity.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. Financing agreement. Before the balance sheet is issued or is available to be issued (as discussed in Section <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">855-10-25</u>), the entity has entered into a financing agreement that clearly permits the entity to refinance the short-term obligation on a long-term basis on terms that are readily determinable, and all of the following conditions are met:


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1. The agreement does not expire within one year (or operating cycle - see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-10-05-7</u>) from the date of the entity's balance sheet and during that period the agreement is not cancelable by the lender or the prospective lender or investor (and obligations incurred under the agreement are not callable during that period) except for violation of a provision with which compliance is objectively determinable or measurable. For purposes of this Subtopic, violation of a provision means failure to meet a condition set forth in the agreement or breach or violation of a provision such as a restrictive covenant, representation, or warranty, whether or not a grace period is allowed or the lender is required to give notice. Financing agreements cancelable for violation of a provision that can be evaluated differently by the parties to the agreement (such as a material adverse change or failure to maintain satisfactory operations) do not comply with this condition.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2. No violation of any provision in the financing agreement exists at the balance sheet date and no available information indicates that a violation has occurred thereafter but before the balance sheet is issued or is available to be issued (as discussed in Section <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">855-10-25</u>), or, if one exists at the balance sheet date or has occurred thereafter, a waiver has been obtained.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">3. The lender or the prospective lender or investor with which the entity has entered into the financing agreement is expected to be financially capable of honoring the agreement.
</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-15</b>  Repayment of a short-term obligation before funds are obtained through a long-term refinancing requires the use of current assets. Therefore, if a short-term obligation is repaid after the balance sheet date and subsequently a long-term obligation or equity securities are issued whose proceeds are used to replenish current assets before the balance sheet is issued or is available to be issued (as discussed in Section <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">855-10-25</u>), the short-term obligation shall not be excluded from current liabilities at the balance sheet date. See Example 5 (paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-10-55-33</u>) for an illustration of this guidance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-16</b> If an entity's ability to consummate an intended refinancing of a short-term obligation on a long-term basis is demonstrated by post-balance-sheet-date issuance of a long-term obligation or equity securities (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-10-45-14(a)</u>), the amount of the short-term obligation to be excluded from current liabilities shall not exceed the proceeds of the new long-term obligation or the equity securities issued.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-17</b>  If ability to refinance is demonstrated by the existence of a financing agreement (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-10-45-14(b)</u>), the amount of the short-term obligation to be excluded from current liabilities shall be reduced to the amount available for refinancing under the agreement if the amount available is less than the amount of the short-term obligation.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-18</b>  The amount to be excluded shall be reduced further if information (such as restrictions in other agreements or restrictions as to transferability of funds) indicates that funds obtainable under the agreement will not be available to liquidate the short-term obligation.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-19</b> Further, if amounts that could be obtained under the financing agreement fluctuate (for example, in relation to the entity's needs, in proportion to the value of collateral, or in accordance with other terms of the agreement), the amount to be excluded from current liabilities shall be limited to a reasonable estimate of the minimum amount expected to be available at any date from the scheduled maturity of the short-term obligation to the end of the fiscal year (or operating cycle - see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-10-05-7</u>). If no reasonable estimate can be made, the entire outstanding short-term obligation shall be included in current liabilities.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-20</b>  The entity may intend to seek an alternative source of financing rather than to exercise its rights under the existing agreement when the short-term obligation becomes due. The entity must intend to exercise its rights under the existing agreement, however, if that other source does not become available. The intent to exercise may not be present if the terms of the agreement contain conditions or permit the prospective lender or investor to establish conditions, such as interest rates or collateral requirements, that are unreasonable to the entity.
