<p class="header">&gt;  Adjustments to Lower of Cost or Market</p>
</p><p id="33035">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-1</b>  A departure from the cost basis of pricing the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">inventory</b> is required when the utility of the goods is no longer as great as their cost. Where there is evidence that the utility of goods, in their disposal in the ordinary course of business, will be less than cost, whether due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes, the difference shall be recognized as a loss of the current period. This is generally accomplished by stating such goods at a lower level commonly designated as <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">market</b>.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-2</b>  The cost basis of recording inventory ordinarily achieves the objective of a proper matching of costs and revenues. However, under certain circumstances cost may not be the amount properly chargeable against the revenues of future periods. A departure from cost is required in these circumstances because cost is satisfactory only if the utility of the goods has not diminished since their acquisition; a loss of utility shall be reflected as a charge against the revenues of the period in which it occurs. Thus, in accounting for inventories, a loss shall be recognized whenever the utility of goods is impaired by damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes. The measurement of such losses shall be accomplished by applying the rule of pricing inventories at the lower of cost or market. This provides a practical means of measuring utility and thereby determining the amount of the loss to be recognized and accounted for in the current period.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-3</b>  The rule of lower of cost or market is intended to provide a means of measuring the residual usefulness of an inventory expenditure. The term <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">market</i> is therefore to be interpreted as indicating utility on the inventory date and may be thought of in terms of the equivalent expenditure which would have to be made in the ordinary course at that date to procure corresponding utility.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-4</b>  As a general guide, utility is indicated primarily by the current cost of replacement of the goods as they would be obtained by purchase or reproduction. In applying the rule, however, judgment must always be exercised and no loss shall be recognized unless the evidence indicates clearly that a loss has been sustained. There are therefore exceptions to such a standard. Replacement or reproduction prices would not be appropriate as a measure of utility when the estimated sales value, reduced by the costs of completion and disposal, is lower, in which case the realizable value so determined more appropriately measures utility.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-5</b>  Furthermore, when the evidence indicates that cost will be recovered with an approximately normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business, no loss shall be recognized even though replacement or reproduction costs are lower. This might be true, for example, in the case of production under firm sales contracts at fixed prices, or when a reasonable volume of future orders is assured at stable selling prices.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-6</b>  If inventory has been the hedged item in a fair value hedge, the inventory's cost basis used in the lower of cost or market accounting shall reflect the effect of the adjustments of its carrying amount made pursuant to paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-25-35-1(b)</u>.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-7</b>  Because of the many variations of circumstances encountered in inventory pricing, the definition of <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">market</b> is intended as a guide rather than a literal rule. It shall be applied realistically in light of the objectives expressed in this Subtopic and with due regard to the form, content, and composition of the inventory. For example, the retail inventory method, if adequate markdowns are currently taken, accomplishes the objectives described herein. It is also recognized that, if a business is expected to lose money for a sustained period, the inventory shall not be written down to offset a loss inherent in the subsequent operations.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-8</b> Depending on the character and composition of the inventory, the rule of lower of cost or market may properly be applied either directly to each item or to the total of the inventory (or, in some cases, to the total of the components of each major category). The method shall be that which most clearly reflects periodic income.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-9</b>  The purpose of reducing inventory to market is to reflect fairly the income of the period. The most common practice is to apply the lower of cost or market rule separately to each item of the inventory. However, if there is only one end-product category the cost utility of the total stock - the inventory in its entirety - may have the greatest significance for accounting purposes.  Accordingly, the reduction of individual items to market may not always lead to the most useful result if the utility of the total inventory to the business is not below its cost. This might be the case if selling prices are not affected by temporary or small fluctuations in current costs of purchase or manufacture.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-10</b>  Similarly, where more than one major product or operational category exists, the application of the lower of cost or market rule to the total of the items included in such major categories may result in the most useful determination of income. When no loss of income is expected to take place as a result of a reduction of cost prices of certain goods because others forming components of the same general categories of finished products have a market equally in excess of cost, such components need not be adjusted to market to the extent that they are in balanced quantities. Thus, in such cases, the rule of lower of cost or market, may be applied directly to the totals of the entire inventory, rather than to the individual inventory items, if they enter into the same category of finished product and if they are in balanced quantities, provided the procedure is applied consistently from year to year.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-11</b>  To the extent, however, that the stocks of particular materials or components are excessive in relation to others, the more widely recognized procedure of applying the lower of cost or market to the individual items constituting the excess shall be followed. This would also apply in cases in which the items enter into the production of unrelated products or products having a material variation in the rate of turnover. Unless an effective method of classifying categories is practicable, the rule shall be applied to each item in the inventory.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-12</b>  See paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">330-10-30-9 through 30-14</u> for guidance on inventory pricing methods.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Loss Due to Sales Incentive</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-13</b>  The offer of a sales incentive that will result in a loss on the sale of a product may indicate an impairment of existing inventory under this Subtopic.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  New Cost Basis</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-14</b>  In the case of goods which have been written down below cost at the close of a fiscal year, such reduced amount is to be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">270-10-45-6</u> provides guidance for preparing interim financial statements.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Stating Inventories Above Cost</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-15</b>  Only in exceptional cases may inventories properly be stated above cost. For example, precious metals having a fixed monetary value with no substantial cost of marketing may be stated at such monetary value; any other exceptions must be justifiable by inability to determine appropriate approximate costs, immediate marketability at quoted market price, and the characteristic of unit interchangeability.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-16</b>  It is generally recognized that income accrues only at the time of sale, and that gains may not be anticipated by reflecting assets at their current sales prices. However, exceptions for reflecting assets at selling prices are permissible for both of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Inventories of gold and silver, when there is an effective government-controlled market at a fixed monetary value
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. Inventories representing agricultural, mineral, and other products, with all of the following criteria:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1. Units of which are interchangeable
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2. Units of which have an immediate marketability at quoted prices
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">3. Units for which appropriate costs may be difficult to obtain.
</p>
</p>
</p><p>Where such inventories are stated at sales prices, they shall be reduced by expenditures to be incurred in disposal.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Purchase Commitments</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-17</b>  A net loss on firm purchase commitments for goods for inventory, measured in the same way as are inventory losses, shall be recognized in the accounts.  The recognition in a current period of losses arising from the decline in the utility of cost expenditures is equally applicable to similar losses which are expected to arise from firm, uncancelable, and unhedged commitments for the future purchase of inventory items.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-18</b>  The utility of such commitments is not impaired, and hence there is no loss, when the amounts to be realized from the disposition of the future inventory items are adequately protected by firm sales contracts or when there are other circumstances that reasonably assure continuing sales without price decline.
