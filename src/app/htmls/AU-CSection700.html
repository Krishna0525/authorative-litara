<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A50  </b>In the case of comparative financial statements, the written representations are requested for all periods referred to in the auditor's opinion because management needs to reaffirm that the written representations it previously made with respect to the prior period remain appropriate.

<i>Opinion on Prior Period Financial Statements Different From Previous Opinion</i>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au700a51">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A51  </b>When reporting on the prior period financial statements in connection with the current period???s audit, the opinion expressed on the prior period financial statements may be different from the opinion previously expressed if the auditor becomes aware of circumstances or events that materially affect the financial statements of a prior period during the course of the audit of the current period. In some circumstances, the auditor may have additional reporting responsibilities designed to prevent future reliance on the auditor's previously issued report on the prior period financial statements.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 24</sup>

</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au700a52">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A52</b>  The predecessor auditor may be unable or unwilling to reissue the auditor's report on the prior period financial statements that have been restated. In this situation, provided that the auditor has audited the adjustments to the prior period financial statements, the auditor may include an other-matter paragraph<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 25</sup> in the auditor's report indicating that the predecessor auditor reported on the financial statements of the prior period before restatement. In addition, if the auditor is engaged to audit and obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence to be satisfied about the appropriateness of the restatement, the auditor's report may also include the following paragraph within the other-matter paragraph section:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">As part of our audit of the 20X2 financial statements, we also audited the adjustments described in Note X that were applied to restate the 20X1 financial statements. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 20X1 financial statements of the Company other than with respect to the adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 20X1 financial statements as a whole.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Matter</i>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">The 20X1 financial statements were reviewed by us (other accountants) and our (their) report thereon, dated March 1, 20X2, stated we (they) were not aware of any material modifications that should be made to those statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. However, a review is substantially less in scope than an audit and does not provide a basis for the expression of an opinion on the financial statements.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au700a54">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A54  </b>If the prior period financial statements were compiled, the following is an example of an other-matter paragraph:

<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Matter</i>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">The 20X1 financial statements were compiled by us (other accountants) and our (their) report thereon, dated March 1, 20X2, stated we (they) did not audit or review those financial statements and, accordingly, express no opinion or other form of assurance on them.
</div>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="au700a55">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A55  </b>If the prior period financial statements were not audited, reviewed, or compiled, the following is an example of an other-matter paragraph:

<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Matter</i>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">The accompanying balance sheet of X Company as of December 31, 20X1, and the related statements of income and cash flows for the year then ended were not audited, reviewed, or compiled by us and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on them.

The auditor's opinion covers information that cannot be clearly differentiated from the financial statements because of its nature and how it is presented.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the organization's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the organization's internal control.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup> Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
