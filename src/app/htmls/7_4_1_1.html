<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-1</b>  The Income Taxes Topic addresses financial accounting and reporting for the effects of income taxes that result from an entity's activities during the current and preceding years. Specifically, this Topic establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for income taxes that are currently payable and for the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">tax consequences</b> of all of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Revenues, expenses, gains, or losses that are included in <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">taxable income</b> of an earlier or later year than the year in which they are recognized in financial income 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Other events that create differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their amounts for financial reporting 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Operating loss or tax credit <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">carrybacks</b> for refunds of taxes paid in prior years and <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">carryforwards</b> to reduce taxes payable in future years.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-5  </b>There are two basic principles related to accounting for income taxes, each of which considers uncertainty through the application of recognition and measurement criteria: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  To recognize the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year as a tax liability or asset 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  To recognize a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">deferred tax liability</b> or <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">asset</b> for the estimated future tax effects attributable to <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">temporary differences</b> and carryforwards. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-6   </b>This Subtopic provides guidance for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that directly or indirectly affect amounts reported in financial statements. This Subtopic also provides accounting guidance for the related income tax effects of individual tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds required in order for any part of the benefit of that tax position to be recognized in an entity's financial statements. Under this Subtopic, a tax position is first evaluated for recognition based on its technical merits. Tax positions that meet a recognition criterion are then measured to determine an amount to recognize in the financial statements. That measurement incorporates information about potential settlements with taxing authorities. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-7   </b>A temporary difference refers to a difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability, determined based on recognition and measurement requirements for tax positions, and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes that result from temporary differences and carryforwards that exist at the end of a period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and provisions of the enacted tax law and are not discounted to reflect the time-value of money. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-8   </b>As indicated in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-25-23</u>, temporary differences that will result in taxable amounts in future years when the related asset or liability is recovered or settled are often referred to as taxable temporary differences. Likewise, temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years are often referred to as deductible temporary differences. Business combinations may give rise to both taxable and deductible temporary differences. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-9   </b>As indicated in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-25-30</u>, certain basis differences may not result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the related asset or liability for financial reporting is recovered or settled and, therefore, may not be temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-10   </b>As indicated in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-25-24</u>, some temporary differences are deferred taxable income or tax deductions and have balances only on the income tax balance sheet and therefore cannot be identified with a particular asset or liability for financial reporting. In such instances, there is no related, identifiable asset or liability for financial reporting, but there is a temporary difference that results from an event that has been recognized in the financial statements and, based on provisions in the tax law, the temporary difference will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years.
