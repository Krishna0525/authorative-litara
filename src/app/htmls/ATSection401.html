<p class="header">Introduction
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="svcct">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01</b>   This section provides guidance to a practitioner who is engaged to issue or does issue an examination or a review report on pro forma financial information. Such an engagement should comply with the general and fieldwork standards established in section 50, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SSAE Hierarchy</i>, and the specific performance and reporting standards set forth in this section. <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 1</sup>  [Revised, November 2006, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 14.] 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="qffck">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02</b>  When pro forma financial information is presented outside the basic financial statements but within the same document, and the practitioner is not engaged to report on the pro forma financial information, the practitioner's responsibilities are described in AU section 550, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Information in Documents Containing Audited Financial Statements</i>, and AU section 711, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filings Under Federal Securities Statutes</i>. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="yykgr">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03</b>  This section does not apply in those circumstances when, for purposes of a more meaningful presentation, a transaction consummated after the balance-sheet date is reflected in the historical financial statements (such as a revision of debt maturities or a revision of earnings per share calculations for a stock split). <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup>

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="rpffi1">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Presentation of Pro Forma Financial Information </b>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="huukh">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04</b>  The objective of pro forma financial information is to show what the significant effects on historical financial information might have been had a consummated or proposed transaction (or event) occurred at an earlier date. Pro forma financial information is commonly used to show the effects of transactions such as the following:


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Business combination
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Change in capitalization
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Disposition of a significant portion of the business
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Change in the form of business organization or status as an autonomous entity
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Proposed sale of securities and the application of the proceeds
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="faezg">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05</b>  This objective is achieved primarily by applying pro forma adjustments to historical financial information. Pro forma adjustments should be based on management's assumptions and give effect to all significant effects directly attributable to the transaction (or event).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="vdkpe">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06</b>  Pro forma financial information should be labeled as such to distinguish it from historical financial information. This presentation should describe the transaction (or event) that is reflected in the pro forma financial information, the source of the historical financial information on which it is based, the significant assumptions used in developing the pro forma adjustments, and any significant uncertainties about those assumptions. The presentation also should indicate that the pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with related historical financial information and that the pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results (such as financial position and results of operations, as applicable) that would have been attained had the transaction (or event) actually taken place earlier.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 3</sup>
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="rpffi2">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conditions for Reporting </b>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="vezgg">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07</b>  The practitioner may agree to report on an examination or a review of pro forma financial information if the following conditions are met.


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    The document that contains the pro forma financial information includes (or incorporates by reference) complete historical financial statements of the entity for the most recent year (or for the preceding year if financial statements for the most recent year are not yet available) and, if pro forma financial information is presented for an interim period, the document also includes (or incorporates by reference) historical interim financial information for that period (which may be presented in condensed form).<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 4</sup> In the case of a business combination, the document should include (or incorporate by reference) the appropriate historical financial information for the significant constituent parts of the combined entity.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    The historical financial statements of the entity (or, in the case of a business combination, of each significant constituent part of the combined entity) on which the pro forma financial information is based have been audited or reviewed.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 5</sup> The practitioner's attestation risk relating to the pro forma financial information is affected by the scope of the engagement providing the practitioner with assurance about the underlying historical financial information to which the pro forma adjustments are applied. Therefore, the level of assurance given by the practitioner on the pro forma financial information, as of a particular date or for a particular period, should be limited to the level of assurance provided on the historical financial statements (or, in the case of a business combination, the lowest level of assurance provided on the underlying historical financial statements of any significant constituent part of the combined entity). For example, if the underlying historical financial statements of each constituent part of the combined entity have been audited at year-end and reviewed at an interim date, the practitioner may perform an examination or a review of the pro forma financial information at year-end but is limited to performing a review of the pro forma financial information at the interim date.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.    The practitioner who is reporting on the pro forma financial information should have an appropriate level of knowledge of the accounting and financial reporting practices of each significant constituent part of the combined entity. This would ordinarily have been obtained by the practitioner auditing or reviewing historical financial statements of each entity for the most recent annual or interim period for which the pro forma financial information is presented. If another practitioner has performed such an audit or a review, the need, by a practitioner reporting on the pro forma financial information, for an understanding of the entity's accounting and financial reporting practices is not diminished, and that practitioner should consider whether, under the particular circumstances, he or she can acquire sufficient knowledge of these matters to perform the procedures necessary to report on the pro forma financial information.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="rpffi3">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Practitioner's Objective </b>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="cfqsu">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08</b>  The objective of the practitioner's examination procedures applied to pro forma financial information is to provide reasonable assurance as to whether -


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Management's assumptions provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the underlying transaction (or event).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The related pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The pro forma column reflects the proper application of those adjustments to the historical financial statements.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="strqb">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09</b>  The objective of the practitioner's review procedures applied to pro forma financial information is to provide negative assurance as to whether any information came to the practitioner's attention to cause him or her to believe that -


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Management's assumptions do not provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the underlying transaction (or event).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The related pro forma adjustments do not give appropriate effect to those assumptions.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The pro forma column does not reflect the proper application of those adjustments to the historical financial statements.
</p>
</p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="rpffi4">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Procedures</b>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="pfisd">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.10</b>  Other than the procedures applied to the historical financial statements,<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 6</sup> the procedures the practitioner should apply to the assumptions and pro forma adjustments for either an examination or a review engagement are as follows.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Obtain an understanding of the underlying transaction (or event), for example, by reading relevant contracts and minutes of meetings of the board of directors and by making inquiries of appropriate officials of the entity, and, in cases, of the entity acquired or to be acquired.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. Obtain a level of knowledge of each constituent part of the combined entity in a business combination that will enable the practitioner to perform the required procedures. Procedures to obtain this knowledge may include communicating with other practitioners who have audited or reviewed the historical financial information on which the pro forma financial information is based. Matters that may be considered include accounting principles and financial reporting practices followed, transactions between the entities, and material contingencies.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. Discuss with management their assumptions regarding the effects of the transaction (or event).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. Evaluate whether pro forma adjustments are included for all significant effects directly attributable to the transaction (or event).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e. Obtain sufficient evidence in support of such adjustments. The evidence required to support the level of assurance given is a matter of professional judgment. The practitioner typically would obtain more evidence in an examination engagement than in a review engagement. Examples of evidence that the practitioner might consider obtaining are purchase, merger or exchange agreements, appraisal reports, debt agreements, employment agreements, actions of the board of directors, and existing or proposed legislation or regulatory actions.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f. Evaluate whether management's assumptions that underlie the pro forma adjustments are presented in a sufficiently clear and comprehensive manner. Also, evaluate whether the pro forma adjustments are consistent with each other and with the data used to develop them.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">g. Determine that computations of pro forma adjustments are mathematically correct and that the pro forma column reflects the proper application of those adjustments to the historical financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">h. Obtain written representations from management concerning their -


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Responsibility for the assumptions used in determining the pro forma adjustments
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Assertion that the assumptions provide a reasonable basis for presenting all of the significant effects directly attributable to the transaction (or event), that the related pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions, and that the pro forma column reflects the proper application of those adjustments to the historical financial statements
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Assertion that the significant effects directly attributable to the transaction (or event) are appropriately disclosed in the pro forma financial information.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">i. Read the pro forma financial information and evaluate whether -

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The underlying transaction (or event), the pro forma adjustments, the significant assumptions and the significant uncertainties, if any, about those assumptions have been appropriately described.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The source of the historical financial information on which the pro forma financial information is based has been appropriately identified.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="tnopi">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11</b>  The practitioner's report on pro forma financial information should be dated as of the completion of the appropriate procedures. The practitioner's report on pro forma financial information may be added to the practitioner's report on historical financial information, or it may appear separately. If the reports are combined and the date of completion of the procedures for the examination or review of the pro forma financial information is after the date of completion of the fieldwork for the audit or review of the historical financial information, the combined report should be dual-dated. (For example, "February 15, 20X2, except for the paragraphs regarding pro forma financial information as to which the date is March 20, 20X2.")
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="sdemw">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12</b>  A practitioner's examination report on pro forma financial information should include the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. A reference to the financial statements from which the historical financial information is derived and a statement that such financial statements were audited (The report on pro forma financial information should refer to any modification in the practitioner's report on the historical financial information.)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. An identification of the responsible party and a statement that the responsible party is responsible for the pro forma financial information
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e. A statement that the practitioner's responsibility is to express an opinion on the pro forma financial information based on his or her examination
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">h. A separate paragraph explaining the objective of pro forma financial information and its limitations
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">i. The practitioner's opinion as to whether management's assumptions provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the transaction (or event), whether the related pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions, and whether the pro forma column reflects the proper application of those adjustments to the historical financial statements (see paragraphs .18 and .20)
