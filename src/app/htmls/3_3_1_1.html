<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Cost Basis</b>
</p><p id="33030">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-1</b>  The primary basis of accounting for inventories is cost, which has been defined generally as the price paid or consideration given to acquire an asset. As applied to inventories, cost means in principle the sum of the applicable expenditures and charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing an article to its existing condition and location. It is understood to mean acquisition and production cost, and its determination involves many considerations. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-2</b>  Although principles for the determination of <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">inventory</b> costs may be easily stated, their application, particularly to such inventory items as work in process and finished goods, is difficult because of the variety of considerations in the allocation of costs and charges.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-3</b>  For example, variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production on
the basis of the actual use of the production facilities. However, the allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Normal
capacity refers to a range of production levels. Normal capacity is the production expected to be
achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into account the loss
of capacity resulting from planned maintenance. Some variation in production levels from period to
period is expected and establishes the range of normal capacity.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-4</b> The range of normal capacity will vary based on business- and industry-specific factors.
Judgment is required to determine when a production level is abnormally low (that is, outside the range
of expected variation in production).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-5</b> Examples of factors that might be anticipated to cause an abnormally low production level include significantly reduced demand, labor and materials shortages, and unplanned facility or equipment downtime. </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-6</b>  The actual level of production may be used if it approximates normal capacity.  In periods of abnormally high production, the amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production shall be decreased so that inventories are not measured above cost.  The amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production shall not be increased as a consequence of abnormally low production or idle plant.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-7</b>  Unallocated overheads shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.  Other items such as abnormal freight, handling costs, and amounts of wasted materials (spoilage) require treatment as current period charges rather than as a portion of the inventory cost.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-8</b>  Also, under most circumstances, general and administrative expenses shall be included as period charges, except for the portion of such expenses that may be clearly related to production and thus constitute a part of inventory costs (product charges).  Selling expenses constitute no part of inventory costs.  The exclusion of all overheads from inventory costs does not constitute an accepted accounting procedure.  The exercise of judgment in an individual situation involves a consideration of the adequacy of the procedures of the cost accounting system in use, the soundness of the principles thereof, and their consistent application.  General and administrative expenses ordinarily shall be charged to expense as incurred but may be accounted for as contract costs under the completed-contract method of accounting or, in some circumstances, as indirect contract costs by government contractors.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Determination of Inventory Costs</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-9</b>  Cost for inventory purposes may be determined under any one of several assumptions as to the flow of cost factors, such as first-in first-out (FIFO), average, and last-in first-out (LIFO).  The major objective in selecting a method should be to choose the one which, under the circumstances, most clearly reflects periodic income.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-10</b>  The cost to be matched against revenue from a sale may not be the identified cost of the specific item which is sold, especially in cases in which similar goods are purchased at different times and at different prices.  While in some lines of business specific lots are clearly identified from the time of purchase through the time of sale and are costed on this basis, ordinarily the identity of goods is lost between the time of acquisition and the time of sale.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-11</b>  Accordingly, if the materials purchased in various lots are identical and interchangeable, the use of identified cost of the various lots may not produce the most useful financial statements.  This fact has resulted in the general acceptance of several assumptions with respect to the flow of cost factors such as FIFO, average, and LIFO to provide practical bases for the measurement of periodic income.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-12</b>  Standard costs are acceptable if adjusted at reasonable intervals to reflect current conditions so that at the balance-sheet date standard costs reasonably approximate costs computed under one of the recognized bases.  In such cases descriptive language shall be used which will express this relationship, as, for instance, "approximate costs determined on the first-in first-out basis," or, if it is desired to mention standard costs, "at standard costs, approximating average costs."
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-13</b>  In some situations a reversed mark-up procedure of inventory pricing, such as the retail inventory method, may be both practical and appropriate.  The business operations in some cases may be such as to make it desirable to apply one of the acceptable methods of determining cost for one portion of the inventory or components thereof and another of the acceptable methods to other portions of the inventory.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-14</b>  Although selection of the method should be made on the basis of the individual circumstances, financial statements will be more useful if uniform methods of inventory pricing are adopted by all companies within a given industry.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Consistency Required</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-15</b>  While the basis of stating inventories does not affect the overall gain or loss on the ultimate disposition of inventory items, any inconsistency in the selection or employment of a basis may improperly affect the periodic amounts of in come or loss.  Because of the common use and importance of periodic statements, a procedure adopted for the treatment of inventory items shall be consistently applied in order that the results may be fairly allocated between years.</p><table border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0"></table></p>
