<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc60001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>Generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) apply to group audits. This section addresses special considerations that apply to group audits, in particular those that involve component auditors.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding a Component Auditor</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc60022">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.22  </b>Regardless of whether reference will be made in the auditor's report on the group financial statements to the audit of a component auditor, the group engagement team should obtain an understanding of the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.  </i>Whether a component auditor understands and will comply with the ethical requirements that are relevant to the group audit and, in particular, is independent 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b.  </i>A component auditor's professional competence
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">c.  </i>The extent, if any, to which the group engagement team will be able to be involved in the work of the component auditor
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d.  </i>Whether the group engagement team will be able to obtain information affecting the consolidation process from a component auditor
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">e.  </i>Whether a component auditor operates in a regulatory environment that actively oversees auditor
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc60023">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.23  </b>When a component auditor does not meet the independence requirements that are relevant to the group audit or the group engagement team has serious concerns about the other matters listed in paragraph .22a-b, the group engagement team should obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence relating to the financial information of the component without making reference to the audit of that component auditor in the auditor's report on the group financial statements or otherwise using the work of that component auditor.
