<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; &gt;  Recognition of Intangible Assets Separately from Goodwill</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-2</b>  Paragraph 805-20-25-10 establishes that an intangible asset is identifiable if it meets either the separability criterion or the contractual-legal criterion described in the definition of identifiable.  An intangible asset that meets the contractual-legal criterion is identifiable even if the asset is not transferable or separable from the acquiree or from other rights and obligations.  For example:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  An acquiree leases a manufacturing facility under an operating lease that has terms that are favorable relative to market therms.  the lease terms explicitly prohibit transfer of the lease (through either sale or sublease).  the amount by which the lease terms are favorable compared with the pricing of current market transactions for the same or similar items is an intangible asset that meets the contractual-legal criterion for recognition separately form goodwill, even though the acquirer cannot sell or otherwise transfer the lease contract.  See also paragraphs 805-20-25-12 through 25-13.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  An acquiree owns and operates a nuclear power plant.  the license to operate that power plant is an intangible asset that meets the contractual-legal criterion for recognition separately from goodwill, even if the acquirer cannot sell or transfer it separately from the acquired power plant.  An acquirer may recognize the fair value of the operating license and the fair value of the power plant as a single asset for financial reporting purposes if the useful lives of those assets are similar.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  An acquiree owns a technology patent.  it has licensed that patent to others for their exclusive use outside the domestic market, receiving a specified percentage of future foreign revenue in exchange.  Both the technology patent and the related license agreement meet the contractual-legal criterion for recognition separately from goodwill even if selling or exchanging the patent and the related license agreement separately from one another would not be practical.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-3</b>  The separability criterion means that an acquired intangible asset is capable of being separated or divided from the acquiree and sold, transferred,licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract, identifiable asset, or liability.  An intangible asset that the acquirer would be able to sell , license, or otherwise exchange for something else of value meets the separability criterion even if the acquirer does not intend to sell, license, or otherwise exchange it.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">55-4</b>  An acquire intangible asset meets the separability criterion if there is a evidence of exchange transactions for that type if asset or an asset of a similar type, even if those transactions are infrequent and regardless of whether the acquirer is involved in them.  For example, customer and subscriber lists are frequently licensed and thus meet the separability criterion.  Even if an acquiree believes its customer lists have characteristics different from other customer lists, the fact that customer lists are frequently licensed generally means that the acquired customer list meets the separability criterion.  However, a customer list acquired in a business combination would not meet the separability criterion if the terms of confidentiality or other agreements prohibit an entity from selling, leasing,or otherwise exchanging information about its customers.
