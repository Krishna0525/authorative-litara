      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.03</b> The engagement quality reviewer must be an associated person of a registered public accounting firm. An engagement quality reviewer from the firm that issues the engagement report (or communicates an engagement conclusion, if no report is issued) must be a partner or another individual in an equivalent position.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">1. In the context of an audit, “engagement report” refers to the audit report (or reports if, in an integrated audit, the auditor issues separate reports on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting). In the context of an engagement to review interim financial information, the term refers to the report on interim financial information. An engagement report might not be issued in connection with a review of interim financial information. <em>See</em> paragraph .03 of AS 4105, <em>Reviews of</em> <em>Interim Financial Information</em>.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. An outside reviewer who is not already associated with a registered public accounting firm would become associated with the firm issuing the report if <em>he or she</em> (rather than, or in addition to, his or her firm or other employer): (1) receives compensation from the firm issuing the report for performing the review or (2) performs the review as agent for the firm issuing the report. <em>See</em> PCAOB Rule 1001(p)(i) for the definition of an associated person of a registered public accounting firm.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">3. The term “engagement partner” has the same meaning as the “practitioner-in-charge of an engagement” in PCAOB interim quality control standard QC sec. 40, <em>The Personnel Management Element of a Firm's System of Quality Control-Competencies Required by a Practitioner-in-Charge of an Attest Engagement</em> . QC sec. 40 describes the competencies required of a practitioner-in-charge of an attest engagement.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">4. Paragraph .13 of AS 1215, <em>Audit Documentation</em>, requires the auditor to identify all significant findings or issues in an engagement completion document.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">5. <em>See</em> paragraphs .04-.06 of AS 2710, <em>Other Information in Documents Containing Audited Financial Statements</em>; AS 4101, <em>Responsibilities Regarding</em> <em>Filings Under Federal Securities Statutes</em>.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">6. <em>See</em> AS 1015, <em>Due Professional Care in the Performance of Work</em>.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">7. Concurring approval of issuance by the engagement quality reviewer also is required when reissuance of an engagement report requires the auditor to update his or her procedures for subsequent events. In that case, the engagement quality reviewer should update the engagement quality review by addressing those matters related to the subsequent events procedures.</p>
