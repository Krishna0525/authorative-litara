    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-2</b> This guidance addresses the concept of depreciation accounting
        and the various factors to consider in selecting the related periods and methods to be used in such accounting.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-3</b> Depreciation expense in financial statements for an asset shall
        be determined based on the asset's useful life.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-4</b> The cost if a productive facility is one of the costs of the
        services it renders during its useful economic life. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require
        that this cost be spread over the expected useful life of the facility in such a way as to allocate it as
        equitably as possible to periods during which services are obtained from the use of the facility. This procedure
        is known as depreciation accounting, a system of accounting which aims to distribute the cost or other basic
        value of tangible capital assets, less salvage (if any), over the estimated useful life of the unit (which may
        be a group of assets) in a systematic and rational manner. It is a process of allocation, not of valuation.

    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-5</b> See paragraph 360-10-35-20 for a discussion of depreciation of

    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-7</b> The declining balance method is an example of one of the
        methods that meet the requirements of being systematic and rational. If the expected productivity or
        revenue-earning power of the asset is relatively greater during the earlier years of its life, or maintenance
        charges tend to increase during later years, the declining-balance method may provide the most satisfactory
        allocation of cost. That conclusion applies to other methods, including the sum-of-the years'-digits method,
        that produce substantially similar results.

    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-21</b> A long-lived asset (asset group) shall be tested for
        recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be
        recoverable. The following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances:


    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group)
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset
        (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition</p>
    <p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could
        affect the value of a long-lived asset (asset group), including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected
        for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset (asset group)

        or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of
        the long-lived asset (asset group)

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">f. A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group)
        will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The
        term more likely than not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-38</b> Costs to sell are the incremental direct costs to transact a sale, that is, the costs that result directly from and are essential to a sale transaction and that would not have been incurred by the entity had the decision to sell not been made. Those costs include broker commissions, legal and title transfer fees, and closing costs that must be incurred before legal title can be transferred. Those costs exclude expected future losses associated with the operations of a long-lived asset (disposal group) while it is classified as held for sale. Expected future operating losses that marketplace participants would not similarly consider in their estimates of the fair value less cost to sell of a long-lived asset (disposal group) classified as held for sale shall not be indirectly recognized as part of an expected loss on the sale is expected loss on the sale by reducing the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) to an amount less than its current fair value less cost to sell. If the sale is expected to occur beyond one year as permitted in the limited situations by paragraph 360-10-45-11, the cost to sell shall be discounted.

Paragraphs 350-20-35-51 through 35-57 provide guidance for allocating goodwill to a lower-level asset group to be disposed of that is part of a reporting until and that constitutes a business. Goodwill is not included in a lower-level asset group to be disposed of that is part of a reporting unit if it does not constitute a business.

        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-40</b> A loss shall be recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value less cost to sell. A gain shall be recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized (for a write-down to fair value less cost to sell). The loss or gain shall adjust only the carrying amount of a long-lived asset, whether classified as held for sale individually or as part of a disposal group.
