<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:  </b>The Recognition Section provides guidance on the required criteria, timing, and location (within the financial statements) for recording a particular item in the financial statements. Disclosure is not recognition.  
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note for Fair Value Option:  </b>Some of the items subject to the guidance in this Subtopic may qualify for application of the Fair Value Option Subsections of Subtopic 825-10. Those Subsections (see paragraph 825-10-05-5) address circumstances in which entities may choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the fair value option). See Section 825-10-15 for guidance on the scope of the Fair Value Option Subsections of the Financial Instruments Topic.

</p><p id="fasb6051525">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">605-15-25-1   </b>If an entity sells its product but gives the buyer the right to return the product, revenue from the sales transaction shall be recognized at time of sale only if all of the following conditions are met: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The seller's price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The buyer has paid the seller, or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product. If the buyer does not pay at time of sale and the buyer's obligation to pay is contractually or implicitly excused until the buyer resells the product, then this condition is not met. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  The buyer's obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  The buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller. This condition relates primarily to buyers that exist on paper, that is, buyers that have little or no physical facilities or employees. It prevents entities from recognizing sales revenue on transactions with parties that the sellers have established primarily for the purpose of recognizing such sales revenue. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  The seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.  The amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated (see paragraphs 605-15-25-3 through 25-4). Because detailed record keeping for returns for each product line might be costly in some cases, this Subtopic permits reasonable aggregations and approximations of product returns. As explained in paragraph 605-15-15-2, exchanges by ultimate customers of one item for another of the same kind, quality, and price (for example, one color or size for another) are not considered returns for purposes of this Subtopic. 
</p>
</p><p>Sales revenue and cost of sales that are not recognized at time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met shall be recognized either when the return privilege has substantially expired or if those conditions subsequently are met, whichever occurs first. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">605-15-25-2   If sales revenue is recognized because the conditions of the preceding paragraph are met, any costs or losses that may be expected in connection with any returns shall be accrued in accordance with Subtopic 450-20. </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">605-15-25-3   </b>The ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of future returns depends on many factors and circumstances that will vary from one case to the next. However, any of the following factors may impair the ability to make a reasonable estimate: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The susceptibility of the product to significant external factors, such as technological obsolescence or changes in demand 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Relatively long periods in which a particular product may be returned 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Absence of historical experience with similar types of sales of similar products, or inability to apply such experience because of changing circumstances, for example, changes in the selling entity's marketing policies or relationships with its customers 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Absence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous transactions. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">605-15-25-4   </b>The existence of one or more of the factors in the preceding paragraph, in light of the significance of other factors, may not be sufficient to prevent making a reasonable estimate; likewise, other factors may preclude a reasonable estimate. 
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; Product Sold and Subsequently Repurchased Subject to an Operating Lease </p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">605-15-25-5   </b>If, as described in paragraph 605-15-05-6, a manufacturer sells a product to a dealer and the customer subsequently enters into an operating lease with the manufacturer or its finance affiliate that acquires that product subject to the lease, the manufacturer may recognize a sale at the time the product is transferred to the dealer if all of the following conditions exist: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The dealer is a substantive and independent entity that transacts business separately with the manufacturer and customers. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The manufacturer has delivered the product to the dealer, and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the dealer, including responsibility for the ultimate sale of the product and for insurability, theft, or damage. A customer's failure to enter into a lease with the finance affiliate (or manufacturer) would not allow the dealer to return the product to the manufacturer. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  The finance affiliate (or manufacturer) has no legal obligation to provide a lease arrangement to a potential customer of the dealer at the time the product is delivered to the dealer. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  The customer has other financing alternatives available from parties unaffiliated with the manufacturer, and the customer is in control of the selection from the financing alternatives.
