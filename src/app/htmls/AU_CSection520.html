<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a1">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A1  </b>Analytical procedures performed near the end of the audit are intended to corroborate audit evidence obtained during the audit of the financial statements to assist the auditor in drawing reasonable conclusions on which to base the auditor's opinion.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definition</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a2">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A2  </b>Analytical procedures include the consideration of comparisons of the entity's financial information with, for example

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>comparable information for prior periods.</li>

<li>anticipated results of the entity, such as budgets or forecasts, or expectations of the auditor, such as an estimation of depreciation.</li>

<li>similar industry information, such as a comparison of the entity's ratio of sales to accounts receivable and gross margin percentages with industry averages or other entities of comparable size in the same industry.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>
</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a3">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A3  </b>Analytical procedures also include consideration of relationships, for example

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>among elements of financial information, such as gross margin percentages, that would be expected to conform to a predictable pattern based on recent history of the entity and industry.</li>

<li>between financial information and relevant nonfinancial information, such as payroll costs to number of employees.</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a4">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A4  </b>Various methods may be used to perform analytical procedures. These methods range from performing simple comparisons to performing complex analyses using advanced statistical techniques. Analytical procedures may be applied to consolidated financial statements, components, and individual elements of information.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A5  </b>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scanning</i> is a type of analytical procedure involving the auditor's exercise of professional judgment to review accounting data to identify significant or unusual items to test. This type of analytical procedure is described further in section 500, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Audit Evidence</i>.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 5</sup>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a6">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A6  </b>A basic premise underlying the application of analytical procedures is that plausible relationships among data may reasonably be expected to exist and continue in the absence of known conditions to the contrary. The reasons that make relationships plausible are an important consideration because data sometimes appears to be related when it is not, which may lead the auditor to erroneous conclusions. In addition, the presence of an unexpected relationship may provide important evidence when appropriately scrutinized.
</p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Substantive Analytical Procedures</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a7">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A7  </b>The auditor's substantive procedures to address the assessed risk of material misstatement for relevant assertions may be tests of details, substantive analytical procedures, or a combination of both. The decision about which audit procedures to perform, including whether to use substantive analytical procedures, is based on the auditor's professional judgment about the expected effectiveness and efficiency of the available audit procedures to reduce the assessed risk of material misstatement to an acceptably low level.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a8">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A8  </b>The expected effectiveness and efficiency of a substantive analytical procedure in addressing risks of material misstatement depends on, among other things, (a) the nature of the assertion, (b) the plausibility and predictability of the relationship, (c) the availability and reliability of the data used to develop the expectation, and (d) the precision of the expectation.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a9">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A9  </b>The auditor may inquire of management about the availability and reliability of information needed to apply substantive analytical procedures and the results of any such analytical procedures performed by the entity. It may be effective to use analytical data prepared by management, provided that the auditor is satisfied that such data is properly prepared.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<i>Suitability of Particular Substantive Analytical Procedures for Given Assertions</i>
</b>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a10">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A10  </b>When more persuasive audit evidence is desired from substantive analytical procedures, more predictable relationships are necessary to develop the expectation. Relationships in a stable environment are usually more predictable than relationships in a dynamic or unstable environment. Relationships involving income statement accounts tend to be more predictable than relationships involving only balance sheet accounts because income statement accounts represent transactions over a period of time, whereas balance sheet accounts represent amounts as of a point in time. Relationships involving transactions subject to management discretion may be less predictable. For example, management may elect to incur maintenance expense rather than replace plant and equipment, or they may delay advertising expenditures.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a11">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A11  </b>Substantive analytical procedures are generally more effective for large volumes of transactions that tend to be predictable over time. The application of planned analytical procedures is based on the expectation that relationships among data exist and continue in the absence of known conditions to the contrary. Particular conditions that can cause variations in these relationships include, for example, specific unusual transactions or events, accounting changes, business changes, random fluctuations, or misstatements. The suitability of a particular analytical procedure will depend upon the auditor's assessment of how effective it will be in detecting a misstatement that, individually or when aggregated with other misstatements, may cause the financial statements to be materially misstated. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc520a12">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A12  </b>In some cases, even an unsophisticated predictive model may be effective as an analytical procedure. For example, when an entity has a known number of employees at fixed rates of pay throughout the period, it may be possible for the auditor to use this data to estimate the total payroll costs for the period with a high degree of accuracy, thereby providing audit evidence for a significant item in the financial statements and reducing the need to perform tests of details on the payroll. The use of widely recognized trade ratios (such as profit margins for different types of retail entities) can often be used effectively in substantive analytical procedures to provide evidence to support the reasonableness of recorded amounts.
