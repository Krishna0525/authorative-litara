</p>

<p>For guidance on the disclosure about modifications of financing receivables, see paragraphs 310-10-50-31 through 50-34.
</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50-2</b>  Information about an impaired loan that has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring involving a modification of terms need not be included in the disclosures required by paragraphs 310-10-50-15(a) and 310-10-50-15(c) in years after the restructuring if both of the following conditions exist:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. The restructuring agreement specifies an interest rate equal to or greater than the rate that the creditor was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The loan is not impaired based on the terms specified by the restructuring agreement.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50-3</b> That exception shall be applied consistently for paragraph 310-10-50-15(a) and 310-10-50-15(c) to all loans restructured in a troubled debt restructuring that meet the criteria in the preceding paragraph.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50-4</b>  Usually, a loan whose terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring already will be identified as impaired.  However, if the creditor has written down a loan and the measure of the restructured loan is equal to or greater than the recorded investment, no impairment would be recognized in accordance wit this Topic.  The creditor is required to disclose the amount of the write-down and the recorded investment in the year of the write-down but is not required to disclose the recorded investment in that loan in later years if the two criteria of paragraph 310-40-50-2 are met.
