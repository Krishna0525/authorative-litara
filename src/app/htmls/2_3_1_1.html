<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Overview and Background Section provides overview and background material for the guidance contained in the Subtopic. It does not provide the historical background or due process. It may contain certain material that users generally consider useful to understand the typical situations addressed by the standards. The Section does not summarize the accounting and reporting requirements.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-1   </b>This Subtopic provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. An <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">accounting change</b> can be a change in an accounting principle, an accounting estimate, or the reporting entity. Guidance for each of these types of changes is presented in separate headings within each Section. Guidance for error corrections is also presented under a separate heading within each Section.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Accounting Changes </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-2   </b>This Subtopic establishes, unless impracticable, <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">retrospective application</b> as the required method for reporting a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">change in accounting principle</b> in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to a newly adopted accounting principle. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-3   </b>This Subtopic provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Error Corrections </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-4   </b>The correction of an <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">error in previously issued financial statements</b> is not an accounting change. However, the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively. Therefore, the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this Subtopic. </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">05-5   </b>This Subtopic also: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Specifies the method of treating error corrections in comparative statements for two or more periods </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Specifies the disclosures required when previously issued statements of income are restated </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Recommends methods of presentation of historical, statistical-type financial summaries that are affected by error corrections. </p>
