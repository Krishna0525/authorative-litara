<p class="header">Introduction and Applicability</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at20101">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section sets forth attestation standards and provides guidance to a practitioner concerning performance and reporting in all agreed-upon procedures engagements, except as noted in paragraph .02. A practitioner also should refer to the following sections of this Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE), which provide additional guidance for certain types of agreed-upon procedures engagements:


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    Section 301, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Financial Forecasts and Projections</i> 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    Section 601, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compliance Attestation</i> 
</p>


</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>This section does not apply to the following:<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 1</sup> 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    Situations in which an auditor reports on specified compliance requirements based solely on an audit of financial statements, as addressed in AU section 623, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Special Reports</i>, paragraphs .19-.21 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    Engagements for which the objective is to report in accordance with AU section 801, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compliance Audits</i>, unless the terms of the engagement specify that the engagement be performed pursuant to SSAEs

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at20103">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03  </b>An agreed-upon procedures engagement is one in which a practitioner is engaged by a client to issue a report of findings based on specific procedures performed on subject matter. The client engages the practitioner to assist specified parties in evaluating subject matter or an assertion as a result of a need or needs of the specified parties.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup>   Because the specified parties require that findings be independently derived, the services of a practitioner are obtained to perform procedures and report his or her findings. The specified parties and the practitioner agree upon the procedures to be performed by the practitioner that the specified parties believe are appropriate. Because the needs of the specified parties may vary widely, the nature, timing, and extent of the agreed-upon procedures may vary as well; consequently, the specified parties assume responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures since they best understand their own needs. In an engagement performed under this section, the practitioner does not perform an examination or a review, as discussed in section 101, and does not provide an opinion or negative assurance.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 3</sup>  (See paragraph .24.) Instead, the practitioner's report on agreed-upon procedures should be in the form of procedures and findings. (See paragraph .31.)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04  </b>As a consequence of the role of the specified parties in agreeing upon the procedures performed or to be performed, a practitioner's report on such engagements should clearly indicate that its use is restricted to those specified parties.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 4</sup>  Those specified parties, including the client, are hereinafter referred to as <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">specified parties</i>.
</p>

<p class="header">Standards
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at20105">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05  </b>The general, fieldwork, and reporting standards for attestation engagements as established in section 50, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SSAE Hierarchy</i>, together with interpretive guidance regarding their application as addressed throughout this section, should be followed by the practitioner in performing and reporting on agreed-upon procedures engagements. [Revised, November 2006, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 14.]

</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Nature, Timing, and Extent of Procedures</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Responsibility of the Specified Parties</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at20111">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11  </b>Specified parties are responsible for the sufficiency (nature, timing, and extent) of the agreed-upon procedures because they best understand their own needs. The specified parties assume the risk that such procedures might be insufficient for their purposes. In addition, the specified parties assume the risk that they might misunderstand or otherwise inappropriately use findings properly reported by the practitioner.
</p>
</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at20112">
<p class="header">Practitioner's Responsibility</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12  </b>The responsibility of the practitioner is to carry out the procedures and report the findings in accordance with the general, fieldwork, and reporting standards as discussed and interpreted in this section. The practitioner assumes the risk that misapplication of the procedures may result in inappropriate findings being reported. Furthermore, the practitioner assumes the risk that appropriate findings may not be reported or may be reported inaccurately. The practitioner's risks can be reduced through adequate planning and supervision and due professional care in performing the procedures, determining the findings, and preparing the report.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.13  </b>The practitioner should have adequate knowledge in the specific subject matter to which the agreed-upon procedures are to be applied. He or she may obtain such knowledge through formal or continuing education, practical experience, or consultation with others.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 5</sup> 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.14  </b>The practitioner has no responsibility to determine the differences between the agreed-upon procedures to be performed and the procedures that the practitioner would have determined to be necessary had he or she been engaged to perform another form of attest engagement. The procedures that the practitioner agrees to perform pursuant to an agreed-upon procedures engagement may be more or less extensive than the procedures that the practitioner would determine to be necessary had he or she been engaged to perform another form of engagement.
</p>
</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Procedures to Be Performed</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at20115">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.15  </b>The procedures that the practitioner and specified parties agree upon may be as limited or as extensive as the specified parties desire. However, mere reading of an assertion or specified information about the subject matter does not constitute a procedure sufficient to permit a practitioner to report on the results of applying agreed-upon procedures. In some circumstances, the procedures agreed upon evolve or are modified over the course of the engagement. In general, there is flexibility in determining the procedures as long as the specified parties acknowledge responsibility for the sufficiency of such procedures for their purposes. Matters that should be agreed upon include the nature, timing, and extent of the procedures.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16  </b>The practitioner should not agree to perform procedures that are overly subjective and thus possibly open to varying interpretations. Terms of uncertain meaning (such as general review, limited review, check, or test) should not be used in describing the procedures unless such terms are defined within the agreed-upon procedures. The practitioner should obtain evidential matter from applying the agreed-upon procedures to provide a reasonable basis for the finding or findings expressed in his or her report, but need not perform additional procedures outside the scope of the engagement to gather additional evidential matter.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.17  </b>Examples of appropriate procedures include the following: 

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Execution of a sampling application after agreeing on relevant parameters</li>

<li>Inspection of specified documents evidencing certain types of transactions or detailed attributes thereof</li>

<li>Confirmation of specific information with third parties</li>

<li>Comparison of documents, schedules, or analyses with certain specified attributes</li>

<li>Performance of specific procedures on work performed by others (including the work of internal auditors - see paragraphs .22 and .23)</li>

<li>Performance of mathematical computations</li>
</ul>
<p></p>


</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.18  </b>Examples of inappropriate procedures include the following:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Mere reading of the work performed by others solely to describe their findings</li>
<li>Evaluating the competency or objectivity of another party</li>

<li>Obtaining an understanding about a particular subject</li>
<li>Interpreting documents outside the scope of the practitioner's professional expertise</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>
</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Involvement of a Specialist<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 6</sup>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at20119">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.19  </b>The practitioner's education and experience enable him or her to be knowledgeable about business matters in general, but he or she is not expected to have the expertise of a person trained for or qualified to engage in the practice of another profession or occupation. In certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to involve a specialist to assist the practitioner in the performance of one or more procedures. The following are examples.

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>An attorney might provide assistance concerning the interpretation of legal terminology involving laws, regulations, rules, contracts, or grants.</li>

<li>A medical specialist might provide assistance in understanding the characteristics of diagnosis codes documented in patient medical records.</li>

<li>An environmental engineer might provide assistance in interpreting environmental remedial action regulatory directives that may affect the agreed-upon procedures applied to an environmental liabilities account in a financial statement.</li>

<li>A geologist might provide assistance in distinguishing between varying physical characteristics of a generic minerals group related to information to which the agreed-upon procedures are applied.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.20  </b>The practitioner and the specified parties should explicitly agree to the involvement of the specialist in assisting a practitioner in the performance of an agreed-upon procedures engagement. This agreement may be reached when obtaining agreement on the procedures performed or to be performed and acknowledgment of responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures, as discussed in paragraph .07. The practitioner's report should describe the nature of the assistance provided by the specialist.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.21  </b>A practitioner may agree to apply procedures to the report or work product of a specialist that does not constitute assistance by the specialist to the practitioner in an agreed-upon procedures engagement. For example, the practitioner may make reference to information contained in a report of a specialist in describing an agreed-upon procedure. However, it is inappropriate for the practitioner to agree to merely read the specialist's report solely to describe or repeat the findings, or to take responsibility for all or a portion of any procedures performed by a specialist or the specialist's work product.
</p>
</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Internal Auditors and Other Personnel</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at20122">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.22  </b>The agreed-upon procedures to be enumerated or referred to in the practitioner's report are to be performed entirely by the practitioner except as discussed in paragraphs .19 to .21.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 7</sup>  However, internal auditors or other personnel may prepare schedules and accumulate data or provide other information for the practitioner's use in performing the agreed-upon procedures. Also, internal auditors may perform and report separately on procedures that they have carried out. Such procedures may be similar to those that a practitioner may perform under this section.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.23  </b>A practitioner may agree to perform procedures on information documented in the working papers of internal auditors. For example, the practitioner may agree to -

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Repeat all or some of the procedures.</li>

<li>Determine whether the internal auditors' working papers contain documentation of procedures performed and whether the findings documented in the working papers are presented in a report by the internal auditors.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<p style="margin-left: 10px;">However, it is inappropriate for the practitioner to -

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>Agree to merely read the internal auditors' report solely to describe or repeat their findings.</li>

<li>Take responsibility for all or a portion of any procedures performed by internal auditors by reporting those findings as the practitioner's own.</li>

<li>Report in any manner that implies shared responsibility for the procedures with the internal auditors.</li>
</ul>
