<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>.04 The objective of the accountant when performing a review of financial statements is to obtain limited assurance as a basis for reporting whether the accountant is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial statements for them to be in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework, primarily through the performance of inquiry and analytical procedures.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>.14 To perform the review engagement, the accountant should possess or obtain an understanding of the industry in which the entity operates, including the accounting principles and practices generally used in the industry, sufficient to enable the accountant to review financial statements that are appropriate for an entity operating in that industry.<br>Knowledge of the Entity</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>.19 The accountant should apply analytical procedures to the financial statements to identify and provide a basis for inquiry about the relationships and individual items that appear to be unusual and that may indicate a material misstatement.

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>
	<ol>
		<li>Comparing the financial statements with comparable information for the prior period, giving consideration to knowledge about changes in the entity's business and specific transactions</li>

		<li>Comparing recorded amounts or ratios developed from recorded amounts to expectations developed by the accountant through identifying and using relationships that are reasonably expected to exist, based on the accountant's understanding of the entity and the industry in which the entity operates</li>
		<li>Comparing disaggregated revenue data, as applicable</li>

		<li>consider the reliability of data from which the accountant's expectation of recorded amounts or ratios is developed, taking into account the source, comparability, and nature and relevance of information available;</li>
		<li>develop an expectation of recorded amounts or ratios and evaluate whether the expectation is sufficiently precise to provide the accountant with limited assurance that a misstatement will be identified that, either individually or when aggregated with other misstatements, may cause the financial statements to be materially misstated; and</li>
		<li>determine the amount of any difference of recorded amounts from expected values that is acceptable without further investigation as required by paragraph .21 and compare the recorded amounts, or ratios developed from recorded amounts, with the expectations.</li>
