<p class="header">&gt;  Recognition Principle for Share-Based Payment Transactions</p>
</p><p id="71825">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-1</b>  The guidance for this section is organized as follows:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Recognition principle for share-based payment transactions
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Determining the grant date
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Determining whether to classify a financial instrument as a liability or as equity
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Market, performance, and service conditions
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  Certain transactions with related parties and other economic interest holders
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.  Payroll taxes.
</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-2</b>  An entity shall recognize the services received in a share-based payment transaction with an employee as services received.  Employee services themselves are not recognized before they are received.  The entity shall recognize either a corresponding increase in equity or a liability, depending on whether the instruments granted satisfy the equity or liability classification criteria (see paragraphs 718-10-25-6 through 25-19).  As the services are consumed, the entity shall recognize the related cost.  For example, as services are consumed, the cost usually is recognized in determining net income of that period, for example, as expenses incurred for employee services.  In some circumstances, the cost of services may be initially capitalized as part of the cost to acquire or construct another asset, such as inventory, and later recognized in the income statement when that asset is disposed of or consumed.  This Topic refers to recognizing compensation cost rather than compensation expense because any compensation cost that is capitalized as part of the cost to acquire or construct an asset would not be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-3</b>  Accounting for all share-based payment transactions shall reflect the rights conveyed to the holder of the instruments and the obligations imposed on the issuer of the instruments, regardless of how those transactions are structured.  For example, the rights and obligations embodied in a transfer of equity shares to an employee for a note that provides no recourse to other assets of the employee (that is, other than the shares) are substantially the same as those embodied in a grant of equity share options.  Thus, that transaction shall be accounted for as a substantive grant of equity share options.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-4</b>  Assessment of both the rights and obligations in a share-based payment award and any related arrangement and how those rights and obligations affect the fair value of an award requires the exercise of judgment in considering the relevant facts and circumstances.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Determining Grant Date</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-5</b>  As a practical accommodation, in determining the grant date of an award subject to this Topic, assuming all other criteria in the grant date definition have been met, a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award to an individual employee shall be presumed to exist at the date the award is approved in accordance with the relevant corporate governance requirements (that is, by the Board or management with the relevant authority) if both of the following conditions are met:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The award is a unilateral grant and, therefore, the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate the key terms and conditions of the award with the employer.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval.  A relatively short time period is that period in which an entity could reasonably complete all actions necessary to communicate the awards to the recipients in accordance with the entity's customary human resource practices.

<p class="header">&gt;  Determining whether to Classify a Financial Instrument as a Liability or As Equity</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-6</b>  This paragraph through paragraph 718-10-25-19 provide guidance for determining whether certain financial instruments awarded in share-based payment transactions are liabilities.  In determining whether an instrument not specifically discussed in those paragraphs shall be classified as a liability or as equity, an entity shall apply generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to financial instruments issued in transactions not involving share-based payments.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-7</b>  Topic 480 excludes from its scope instruments that are accounted for under this Topic.  Nevertheless, unless paragraphs 718-10-25-08 through 25-19 require otherwise, an entity shall apply the classification criteria in Section 480-10-25 and paragraphs 480-10-15 through 15-4, as they are effective at the reporting date, in determining whether to classify as a liability a freestanding financial instrument given to an employee in a share-based payment transaction.  Paragraphs 718-10-35-9 through 35-14 provide criteria for determining when instruments subject to this Topic subsequently become subject to Topic 480 or other applicable GAAP.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-8</b>  In determining the classification of an instrument, an entity shall take into account the classification requirements that are effective for that specific entity at the reporting date as established by Topic 480.  In addition, a call option written on an instrument that is not classified as a liability under those classification requirements (for example, a call option on a madatorily redeemable share for which liability classification is not required for the specific entity under the requirements effective at the reporting date) also shall be classified as equity so long as those equity classification requirements for the entity continue to be met, unless liability classification is required under the provisions of paragraphs 718-10-25-11 through 25-12.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-9</b>  Topic 480 does not apply to outstanding shares embodying a conditional obligation to transfer assets, for example, shares that give the employee the right to require the employer to repurchase them for cash equal to their fair value (puttable shares).  A put right may be granted to the employee in a transaction that is related to a share-based compensation agreement.  If exercise of such a put right would require the entity to repurchase shares issued under the share-based compensation arrangement, the shares shall be accounted for as puttable shares.  A puttable (or callable) share awarded to an employee as compensation shall be classified as a liability if either of the following conditions is met:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The repurchase feature permits the employee to avoid bearing the risks and rewards normally associated with equity share ownership for a reasonable period of time from the date the requisite service is rendered and the share is issued.  An employee begins to bear the risks and rewards normally associated with equity share ownership when all the requisite service has been rendered.  A repurchase feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employee's control (such as an initial public offering) would not meet this condition until it becomes probable that the event will occur within the reasonable period of time.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  It is probable that the employer would prevent the employee from bearing those risks and rewards for a reasonable period of time from the date the share is issued.
</p>

</p><p>For this purpose, a period of six months or more is a reasonable period of time.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-10</b>  A puttable (or callable) share that does not meet either of those conditions shall be classified as equity (see paragraph 718-10-55-85).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-11</b>  Options or similar instruments on shares shall be classified as liabilities if either of the following conditions is met:


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The underlying shares are classified as liabilities.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The entity can be required under any circumstances to settle the option or similar instrument by transferring cash or other assets.  A cash settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employee's control (such as an initial public offering) would not meet this condition until it becomes probable that event will occur.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-12</b>  For example, a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registrant may grant an option to an employee that, upon exercise, would be settled by issuing a mandatorily redeemable share.  Because the mandatorily redeemable share would be classified as a  liability under Topic 480, the option also would be classified as a liability.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-13</b>  An award may be indexed to a factor in addition to the entity's share price.  If that additional factor is not a market, performance, or service condition, the award shall be classified as a liability for purposes of this Topic, and the additional factor shall be reflected in estimating the fair value of the award.  Paragraph 718-10-55-65 provides examples of such awards.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-14</b>  For this purpose an award of equity share options granted to an employee of an entity's foreign operation that provides for a fixed exercise price denominated either in the foreign operation's functional currency or in the currency in which the employee's pay is denominated shall not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition.  Therefore, such an award is not required to be classified as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity.  For example, equity share options with an exercise price denominated in euros granted to employees of a U.S. entity's foreign operation whose functional currency is the euro are not required to be classified as liabilities if those options otherwise qualify as equity.  In addition, such options are not required to be classified as liabilities even if the functional currency of the foreign operation is the U.S. dollar, provided that the employees to whom the options are granted are paid in euros.
