<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Recognition Section provides guidance on the required criteria, timing, and location (within the financial statements) for recording a particular item in the financial statements. Disclosure is not recognition. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note for Fair Value Option: </b>Some of the items subject to the guidance in this Subtopic may qualify for application of the Fair Value Option Subsections of Subtopic 825-10. Those Subsections (see paragraph 825-10-05-5) address circumstances in which entities may choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the fair value option). See Section 825-10-15 for guidance on the scope of the Fair Value Option Subsections of the Financial Instruments Topic.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-1   </b>An <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">embedded derivative</b> shall be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument pursuant to Subtopic 815-10 if and only if all of the following criteria are met: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">hybrid instrument</b> is not remeasured at <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fair value</b> under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  A separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would, pursuant to Section 815-10-15, be a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of this Subtopic. (The initial net investment for the hybrid instrument shall not be considered to be the initial net investment for the embedded derivative.) 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-2   </b>The notion of an embedded derivative in a hybrid instrument refers to provisions incorporated into a single contract, and not to provisions in separate contracts between different counterparties. Paragraph 815-10-15-6 states that an option that is added or attached to an existing debt instrument by another party results in the investor having different counterparties for the option and the debt instrument and, thus, the option shall not be considered an embedded derivative. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-3   </b>The remainder of the guidance in this Section is organized as follows: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Fair value election for hybrid financial instruments </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Compound embedded derivative </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Interests in securitized financial assetsâ€”holder's accounting </p>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Fair Value Election for Hybrid Financial Instruments </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-4   </b>An entity that initially recognizes a hybrid financial instrument that under paragraph 815-15-25-1 would be required to be separated into a host contract and a derivative instrument may irrevocably elect to initially and subsequently measure that hybrid financial instrument in its entirety at fair value (with changes in fair value recognized in earnings). A financial instrument shall be evaluated to determine that it has an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation before the instrument can become a candidate for the fair value election. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-5   </b>The fair value election shall be supported by concurrent documentation or a preexisting documented policy for automatic election. That recognized hybrid financial instrument could be an asset or a liability and it could be acquired or issued by the entity. The fair value election is also available when a previously recognized <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">financial instrument</b> is subject to a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">remeasurement event (new basis event)</b> and the separate recognition of an embedded derivative. The fair value election may be made instrument by instrument. For purposes of this paragraph, a remeasurement event (new basis event) is an event identified in generally accepted accounting principles, other than the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, that requires a financial instrument to be remeasured to its fair value at the time of the event but does not require that instrument to be reported at fair value on a continuous basis with the change in fair value recognized in earnings. Examples of remeasurement events are business combinations and significant modifications of debt as defined in Subtopic 470-50.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-6   </b>The fair value election shall not be applied to the hybrid instruments described in paragraph 825-10-50-8. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Compound Embedded Derivative </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-7   </b>If a hybrid instrument contains more than one embedded derivative feature that would individually warrant separate accounting as a derivative instrument under paragraph 815-15-25-1, those embedded derivative features shall be bundled together as a single, compound embedded derivative that shall then be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the host contract under this Subtopic unless a fair value election is made pursuant to paragraph 815-15-25-4. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-8   </b>An entity shall not separate a compound embedded derivative into components representing different risks (for example, based on the risks discussed in paragraphs 815-20-25-12[f] and 815-20-25-15[i]) and then account for those components separately. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-9   </b>If a compound embedded derivative comprises multiple embedded derivative features that all involve the same risk exposure (for example, the risk of changes in market interest rates, the creditworthiness of the obligor, or foreign currency exchange rates), but those embedded derivative features differ from one another by including or excluding optionality or by including a different optionality exposure, an entity shall not separate that compound embedded derivative into components that would be accounted for separately. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-15-25-10   </b>If some of the embedded derivative features in a hybrid instrument are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, those embedded derivative features shall not be included in the compound embedded derivative that is bifurcated from the host contract and separately accounted for.
