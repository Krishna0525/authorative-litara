<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement on Standards for Tax
Services No. 6, Knowledge of
Error: Return Preparation and
Administrative Proceedings</b>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. </b>This statement sets forth the applicable standards for a member
who becomes aware of (a) an error in a taxpayers previously filed
tax return; (b) an error in a return that is the subject of an administrative
proceeding, such as an examination by a taxing authority or an
appeals conference; or (c) a taxpayers failure to file a required tax
return. As used herein, the term error includes any position, omission,
or method of accounting that, at the time the return is filed, fails to
meet the standards set out in Statement on Standards for Tax Services
(SSTS) No. 1, Tax Return Positions. The term error also includes
a position taken on a prior years return that no longer meets these
standards due to legislation, judicial decisions, or administrative pronouncements
having retroactive effect. However, an error does not
include an item that has an insignificant effect on the taxpayers tax
liability. The term administrative proceeding does not include a criminal
proceeding.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. </b>This statement applies whether or not the member prepared
or signed the return that contains the error.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. </b>Special considerations may apply when a member has been
engaged by legal counsel to provide assistance in a matter relating to
the counsels client.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. </b>A member should inform the taxpayer promptly upon becoming
aware of an error in a previously filed return, an error in a return
that is the subject of an administrative proceeding, or a taxpayers failure
to file a required return. A member also should advise the taxpayer
of the potential consequences of the error and recommend the corrective measures to be taken. Such advice and recommendation may be
given orally. The member is not allowed to inform the taxing authority
without the taxpayers permission, except when required by law
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. </b>If a member is requested to prepare the current years return
and the taxpayer has not taken appropriate action to correct an error
in a prior years return, the member should consider whether to withdraw
from preparing the return and whether to continue a professional
or employment relationship with the taxpayer. If the member
does prepare such current years return, the member should take reasonable
steps to ensure that the error is not repeated.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. </b>If a member is representing a taxpayer in an administrative
proceeding with respect to a return that contains an error of which the
member is aware, the member should request the taxpayers agreement
to disclose the error to the taxing authority. Lacking such agreement,
the member should consider whether to withdraw from representing
the taxpayer in the administrative proceeding and whether to
continue a professional or employment relationship with the taxpayer.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Explanation </b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7. </b>While performing services for a taxpayer, a member may
become aware of an error in a previously filed return or may become
aware that the taxpayer failed to file a required return. The member
should advise the taxpayer of the error and the potential consequences,
and recommend the measures to be taken. Similarly, when representing
the taxpayer before a taxing authority in an administrative
proceeding with respect to a return containing an error of which the
member is aware, the member should advise the taxpayer to disclose
the error to the taxing authority and of the potential consequences
of not disclosing the error. Such advice and recommendation may be
given orally.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">8. </b>It is the taxpayers responsibility to decide whether to correct
the error. If the taxpayer does not correct an error, a member should
consider whether to withdraw from the engagement and whether to
continue a professional or employment relationship with the taxpayer.
Although recognizing that the taxpayer may not be required by statute
to correct an error by filing an amended return, a member should
consider whether a taxpayers decision not to file an amended return or otherwise correct an error may predict future behavior that might
require termination of the relationship.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">9. </b>Once the member has obtained the taxpayers consent to disclose
an error in an administrative proceeding, the disclosure should
not be delayed to such a degree that the taxpayer or member might
be considered to have failed to act in good faith or to have, in effect,
provided misleading information. In any event, disclosure should be
made before the conclusion of the administrative proceeding.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10. </b>	 A conflict between the members interests and those of the
taxpayer may be created by, for example, the potential for violating
Code of Professional Conduct Rule 301, Confidential Client Information
(AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 2, ET sec. 301 par..01)
(relating to the members confidential client relationship); the tax law
and regulations; or laws on privileged communications, as well as by
the potential adverse impact on a taxpayer of a members withdrawal.
Therefore, a member should consider consulting with his or her own
legal counsel before deciding upon recommendations to the taxpayer
and whether to continue a professional or employment relationship
with the taxpayer.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">11. </b>If a member believes that a taxpayer may face possible exposure
to allegations of fraud or other criminal misconduct, the member
should advise the taxpayer to consult with an attorney before the taxpayer
takes any action
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">12. </b>If a member decides to continue a professional or employment
relationship with the taxpayer and is requested to prepare a tax
return for a year subsequent to that in which the error occurred, the
member should take reasonable steps to ensure that the error is not
repeated. If the subsequent years tax return cannot be prepared without
perpetuating the error, the member should consider withdrawal
from the return preparation. If a member learns that the taxpayer is
using an erroneous method of accounting and it is past the due date
to request permission to change to a method meeting the standards of
SSTS No. 1, the member may sign a tax return for the current year,
providing the tax return includes appropriate disclosure of the use of
the erroneous method.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">13. </b>Whether an error has no more than an insignificant effect on
the taxpayers tax liability is left to the professional judgment of the
member based on all the facts and circumstances known to the member. In judging whether an erroneous method of accounting has more
than an insignificant effect, a member should consider the methods
cumulative effect, as well as its effect on the current years tax return
or the tax return that is the subject of the administrative proceeding.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">14. </b>If a member becomes aware of the error while performing
services for a taxpayer that do not involve tax return preparation or
representation in an administrative proceeding, the members responsibility
is to advise the taxpayer of the existence of the error and to
recommend that the error be discussed with the taxpayers tax return
preparer. Such recommendation may be given orally.
