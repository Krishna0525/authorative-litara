<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement on Standards for Tax
Services No. 5, Departure From a
Position Previously Concluded in
an Administrative Proceeding or
Court Decision</b>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. </b>This statement sets forth the applicable standards for members
in recommending a tax return position that departs from the position
determined in an administrative proceeding or in a court decision
with respect to the taxpayers prior return.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. </b>For purposes of this statement, administrative proceeding
includes an examination by a taxing authority or an appeals conference
relating to a return or a claim for refund.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. </b>For purposes of this statement, court decision means a decision
by any court having jurisdiction over tax matters.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. </b>The tax return position with respect to an item as determined
in an administrative proceeding or court decision does not restrict a
member from recommending a different tax position in a later years
return, unless the taxpayer is bound to a specified treatment in the later
year, such as by a formal closing agreement. Therefore, the member
may recommend a tax return position or prepare or sign a tax return
that departs from the treatment of an item as concluded in an administrative
proceeding or court decision with respect to a prior return of
the taxpayer provided the requirements of Statement on Standards for
Tax Services (SSTS) No. 1, Tax Return Positions, are satisfied.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. </b>If an administrative proceeding or court decision has resulted
in a determination concerning a specific tax treatment of an item in a
prior years return, a member will usually recommend this same tax
treatment in subsequent years. However, departures from consistent
treatment may be justified under such circumstances as the following
<ol type="a">
	<li>Taxing authorities tend to act consistently in the disposition of
an item that was the subject of a prior administrative proceeding
but generally are not bound to do so. Similarly, a taxpayer
is not bound to follow the tax treatment of an item as consented
to in an earlier administrative proceeding.</li>
	<li>The determination in the administrative proceeding or the
courts decision may have been caused by a lack of documentation.
Supporting data for the later year may be appropriate.</li>
	<li>A taxpayer may have yielded in the administrative proceeding
for settlement purposes or not appealed the court decision,
even though the position met the standards in SSTS No. 1.</li>
	<li>Court decisions, rulings, or other authorities that are more
favorable to a taxpayers current position may have developed
since the prior administrative proceeding was concluded or
the prior court decision was rendered.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. </b>The consent in an earlier administrative proceeding and the
existence of an unfavorable court decision are factors that the member
should consider in evaluating whether the standards in SSTS No. 1 are
met.
