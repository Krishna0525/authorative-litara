<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-1</b>  
Investments in <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">debt securities</b> and <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">equity securities</b> shall be measured subsequently as follows: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trading securities</b>. Investments in debt securities that are classified as <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">trading</b> and equity securities that have <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">readily determinable fair values</b> that are classified as trading shall be measured subsequently at <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fair value</b> in the statement of financial position. Unrealized <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">holding gains and losses</b> for trading securities shall be included in earnings. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Available-for-sale securities</b>. Investments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values that are classified as available for sale shall be measured subsequently at fair value in the statement of financial position. Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities (including those classified as current assets) shall be excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income until realized except as indicated in the following sentence. All or a portion of the unrealized holding gain and loss of an available-for-sale security that is designated as being hedged in a fair value hedge shall be recognized in earnings during the period of the hedge, pursuant to paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-25-35-1 through 35-4</u>. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Held-to-maturity securities. Investments in debt securities classified as held to maturity shall be measured subsequently at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. A transaction gain or loss on a held-to-maturity foreign-currency-denominated <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">debt security</b> shall be accounted for pursuant to Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-20</u>. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-2</b>  The fair value of restricted stock shall be measured subsequently based on the quoted price of an otherwise identical unrestricted <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">security</b> of the same issuer, adjusted for the effect of the restriction, in accordance with the provisions of Topic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">820</u>. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-3</b>  Paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-35-23 through 35-26</u> identify circumstances in which an entity must adjust the basis of its investments in debt and equity securities of an equity method investee for the amount of an equity method loss based on its seniority. For investments accounted for in accordance with this Subtopic, the adjusted basis resulting from the application of paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-35-23 through 35-26</u> becomes the security's basis from which subsequent changes in fair value are measured. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-4</b>  Dividend and interest income, including amortization of the premium and discount arising at acquisition, for all three categories of investments in securities shall be included in earnings.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Reassessment of Classification </b>  </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-35-5</b>  At each reporting date, the appropriateness of the classification of an entity's investments in debt and equity securities shall be reassessed. For example, if an entity no longer has the ability to hold securities to maturity, their continued classification as held-to-maturity would not be appropriate. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-6</b>  Because an entity is expected not to change its intent about a held-to-maturity security, the requirement to reassess the appropriateness of a security's classification focuses on the entity's ability to hold a security to maturity. The preceding paragraph acknowledges that facts and circumstances can change; for example, an entity can lose the ability to hold a debt security to maturity. However, that acknowledgment in no way diminishes the restrictive nature of the held-to-maturity category. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-7</b>  After securities are reclassified to available-for-sale in response to a taint, judgment is required in determining when circumstances have changed such that management can assert with a greater degree of credibility that it now has the intent and ability to hold debt securities to maturity. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;  Sales and Transfers that Taint the Entity's Held-to-Maturity Intent</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10-35-8</b>  A sale or transfer of a security classified as held-to-maturity that occurs for a reason other than those specified in paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-25-6</u>, <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-25-9</u>, and <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-25-14</u>, calls into question (taints) the entity's intent about all securities that remain in the held-to-maturity category. The entity makes the same assertion about all debt securities in the held-to-maturity category - namely, that it has the positive intent and ability to hold each security to maturity. Only a sale or transfer in response to certain changes in conditions will not call into question an entity's intent to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-9</b>  When a sale or transfer of held-to-maturity securities represents a material contradiction with the entity's stated intent to hold those securities to maturity or when a pattern of such sales has occurred, any remaining held-to-maturity securities shall be reclassified to available-for-sale. The reclassification shall be recorded in the reporting period in which the sale or transfer occurred and accounted for as a transfer under the following paragraph. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Transfers of Securities Between Categories </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-10</b>  The transfer of a security between categories of investments shall be accounted for at fair value. At the date of the transfer, the security's unrealized holding gain or loss shall be accounted for as follows: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  For a security transferred from the trading category, the unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of the transfer will have already been recognized in earnings and shall not be reversed. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  For a security transferred into the trading category, the portion of the unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of the transfer that has not been previously recognized in earnings shall be recognized in earnings immediately. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  For a debt security transferred into the available-for-sale category from the held-to-maturity category, the unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of the transfer shall be reported in other comprehensive income. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  For a debt security transferred into the held-to-maturity category from the available-for-sale category, the unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of the transfer shall continue to be reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity, such as accumulated other comprehensive income, but shall be amortized over the remaining life of the security as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of any premium or discount. The amortization of an unrealized holding gain or loss reported in equity will offset or mitigate the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount (discussed in the following sentence) for that held-to-maturity security. For a debt security transferred into the held-to-maturity category, the use of fair value may create a premium or discount that, under amortized cost accounting, shall be amortized thereafter as an adjustment of yield pursuant to Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">310-20</u>. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-11</b>  Transfers from the held-to-maturity category should be rare, except for transfers due to the changes in circumstances identified in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-25-6(a) through (f)</u>. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-12</b>  In addition, given the nature of a trading security, transfers into or from the trading category also should be rare. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-13</b>  Available-for-sale securities shall not be automatically transferred to the trading category because the passage of time has caused the maturity date to be within one year or because management intends to sell the security within one year. Similarly, if an entity plans to sell a security from the held-to-maturity category in response to one of the conditions in paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-25-6</u> and <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-25-9</u>, the security shall not be automatically reclassified to available-for-sale or trading before the sale. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">335-14</b>  Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">860-10-55-75</u> gives an Example addressing whether a transferor has the option to classify debt securities as trading at the time of a transfer.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-15</b>  When a security is transferred from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale, the security's <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">amortized cost basis</b> carries over to the available-for-sale category for all of the following purposes: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The subsequent amortization of the historical premium or discount 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The comparisons of fair value and amortized cost for the purpose of determining unrealized holding gains and losses under paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-35-1</u> 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The required disclosures of amortized cost. 
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-16</b>  When a security is transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, the difference between the par value of the security and its fair value at the date of transfer is amortized as a yield adjustment in accordance with Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">310-20</u>. That fair value amount, adjusted for subsequent amortization, becomes the security's amortized cost basis for the disclosures required by paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-50-2 through 50-3</u>, <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-50-5</u>, and <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">320-10-50-10</u>.
