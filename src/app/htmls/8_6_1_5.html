<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">842-20-40-2 </b>The termination of a <b>lease</b> that results from the purchase of an <b>underlying asset</b> by the <b>lessee</b> is not the type of termination of a lease contemplated by paragraph 842-20-40-1 but, rather, is an integral part of the purchase of the underlying asset. If the lessee purchases the underlying asset, any difference between the purchase price and the carrying amount of the lease liability immediately before the purchase shall be recorded by the lessee as an adjustment of the carrying amount of the asset. However, this paragraph does not apply to underlying assets acquired in a <b>business combination</b>, which are initially measured at <b>fair value</b> in accordance with paragraph 805-20-30-1.
