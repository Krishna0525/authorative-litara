</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>
</p><p id="aud54001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01 </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibilities relating to accounting estimates, including fair value accounting estimates and related disclosures, in an audit of financial statements. Specifically, it expands on how section 315, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement; section 330, Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained</i>; and other relevant AU-C sections are to be applied with regard to accounting estimates. It also includes requirements and guidance related to misstatements of individual accounting estimates and indicators of possible management bias.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nature of Accounting Estimates</b>
</p><p id="aud54002">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02 </b>Some financial statement items cannot be measured precisely but can only be estimated. For purposes of this section, such financial statement items are referred to as <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">accounting estimates</i>. The nature and reliability of information available to management to support the making of an accounting estimate varies widely, which thereby affects the degree of estimation uncertainty associated with accounting estimates. The degree of estimation uncertainty affects, in turn, the risks of material misstatement of accounting estimates, including their susceptibility to unintentional or intentional management bias. (Ref: par. .A1â€“.A10 and .A136)
</p><p id="aud54003">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03 </b>The measurement objective of accounting estimates can vary, depending on the applicable financial reporting framework and the financial item being reported.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</sup> The measurement objective for some accounting estimates is to forecast the outcome of one or more transactions, events, or conditions giving rise to the need for the accounting estimate. For other accounting estimates, including many fair value accounting estimates, the measurement objective is different and is expressed in terms of the value of a current transaction or financial statement item based on conditions prevalent at the measurement date, such as estimated market price for a particular type of asset or liability.  For example, the applicable financial reporting framework may require fair value measurement based on an assumed hypothetical current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties (sometimes referred to as market participants or equivalent) in an arm's length transaction, rather than the settlement of a transaction at some past or future date.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sup>
</p><p id="aud54004">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04 </b>A difference between the outcome of an accounting estimate and the amount originally recognized or disclosed in the financial statements does not necessarily represent a misstatement of the financial statements; rather, it could be an outcome of estimation uncertainty (see paragraph .02). This is particularly the case for fair value accounting estimates because any observed outcome may be affected by events or conditions subsequent to the date at which the measurement is estimated for purposes of the financial statements.
