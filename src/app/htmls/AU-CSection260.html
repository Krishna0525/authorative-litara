<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc26001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibility to communicate with those charged with governance in an audit of financial statements. Although this section applies regardless of an entity's governance structure or size, particular considerations apply when all of those charged with governance are involved in managing an entity. This section does not establish requirements regarding the auditor's communication with an entity's management or owners unless they are also charged with a governance role.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc26002">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>This section is written in the context of an audit of financial statements but may also be applied, adapted as necessary in the circumstances, to audits of other historical financial information when those charged with governance have a responsibility to oversee the preparation and fair presentation of the other historical financial information. 
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc26003">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03  </b>Recognizing the importance of effective two-way communication in an audit of financial statements, this section provides an overarching framework for the auditor's communication with those charged with governance and identifies some specific matters to be communicated. Additional matters to be communicated are identified in other AU-C sections (see the exhibit, "Requirements to Communicate With Those Charged With Governance in Other AU-C Sections"). In addition, section 265, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communicating Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an Audit</i>, establishes specific requirements regarding the communication of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control the auditor has identified during the audit to those charged with governance. Further matters not required by generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) may be required to be communicated by agreement with those charged with governance or management or in accordance with external requirements. Nothing in this section precludes the auditor from communicating any other matters to those charged with governance.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a.  </i>uncorrected misstatements accumulated by the auditor and the effect that they, individually or in the aggregate, may have on the opinion in the auditor's report. The auditor's communication should identify material uncorrected misstatements individually. The auditor should request that uncorrected misstatements be corrected. 
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">

<i>Forms of Communication</i>
</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc26016">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16  </b>The auditor should communicate in writing with those charged with governance significant findings or issues from the audit (see paragraphs .12-.14Open this link as a new document) if, in the auditor's professional judgment, oral communication would not be adequate. This communication need not include matters that arose during the course of the audit that were communicated with those charged with governance and satisfactorily resolved.

<i>Significant Findings From the Audit</i>
</b>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc260a23">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A23  </b>The communication of significant findings from the audit may include requesting further information from those charged with governance in order to complete the audit evidence obtained. For example, the auditor may confirm that those charged with governance have the same understanding of the facts and circumstances relevant to specific transactions or events. 
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Qualitative Aspects of the Entity's Significant Accounting Practices</i>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc260a24">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A24  </b>Financial reporting frameworks ordinarily allow for the entity to make accounting estimates and judgments about accounting policies and financial statement disclosures. Open and constructive communication about qualitative aspects of the entity's significant accounting practices may include comment on the acceptability of significant accounting practices. The appendix, "Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices," identifies matters that may be included in this communication.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc260a25">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A25  </b>Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management's current judgments. In communicating with those charged with governance about the process used by management in formulating particularly sensitive accounting estimates, including fair value estimates, and about the basis for the auditor's conclusions regarding the reasonableness of those estimates, the auditor may consider communicating

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>the nature of significant assumptions,</li>

<li>the degree of subjectivity involved in the development of the assumptions, and</li>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc260a26">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A26  </b>Significant difficulties encountered during the audit may include matters such as

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>significant delays in management providing required information. </li>

<li>an unnecessarily brief time within which to complete the audit. </li>

<li>extensive unexpected effort required to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence. </li>

<li>the unavailability of expected information. </li>

<li>restrictions imposed on the auditor by management. </li>

<li>management's unwillingness to provide information about management's plans for dealing with the adverse effects of the conditions or events that lead the auditor to believe there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">In some circumstances, such difficulties may constitute a scope limitation that leads to a modification of the auditor's opinion.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Findings or Issues</i>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc260a27">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A27  </b>The auditor may become aware that the entity is subject to an audit requirement that is not encompassed in the terms of the engagement. The communication to those charged with governance that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS may not satisfy the relevant legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements may be necessary if, for example, an entity engages an auditor to perform an audit of its financial statements in accordance with GAAS and the auditor becomes aware that by law, regulation, or contractual agreement the entity also is required to have an audit performed in accordance with one or more of the following:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc260a28">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A28  </b>Discussions with those charged with governance include any disagreements with management that arose during the audit, regardless of whether they were satisfactorily resolved, about matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant to the entity's financial statements or the auditor's report. Disagreements with management may occasionally arise over, among other things, the application of accounting principles to the entity's specific transactions and events and the basis for management's judgments about accounting estimates. Disagreements may also arise regarding the scope of the audit, disclosures to be included in the entity's financial statements, and the wording of the auditor's report. For purposes of this section, disagreements do not include differences of opinion based on incomplete facts or preliminary information that are later resolved.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc260a29">

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A30  </b>The auditor may discuss with those charged with governance the reasons for, and the implications of, a failure to correct misstatements, taking into account the size and nature of the misstatement judged in the surrounding circumstances, and possible implications with regard to future financial statements.
