<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01 </b>This section applies to engagements in which a CPA in the practice of
public accounting is engaged to issue, or does issue, a practitioner's examination,
review, or agreed-upon procedures report on subject matter or an assertion
about subject matter (hereinafter referred to as an assertion) that is the
responsibility of another party. (Ref: par. .A1)<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sup>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02 </b>An attestation engagement is predicated on the concept that a party
other than the practitioner makes an assertion about whether the subject matter
is measured or evaluated in accordance with suitable criteria. Section 205,
Examination Engagements; section 210, Review Engagements; and section 215,
Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements, require the practitioner to request such
an assertion in writing when performing an examination, review, or agreedupon
procedures engagement.1 In examination and review engagements, when
the engaging party is the responsible party, the responsible party's refusal to
provide a written assertion requires the practitioner to withdraw from the engagement
when withdrawal is possible under applicable laws and regulations.2
In examination and review engagements, when the engaging party is not the
responsible party and the responsible party refuses to provide a written assertion,
the practitioner need not withdraw from the engagement but is required
to disclose that refusal in the practitioner's report and restrict the use of the
report to the engaging party.3 In an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the
responsible party's refusal to provide a written assertion requires the practitioner
to disclose that refusal in the report.4

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .03</b>This section is not applicable to professional services for which the
AICPA has established other professional standards, for example, services performed
in accordance with (Ref: par. .A2–.A3)

	<ol type="a">
		<li>Statements on Auditing Standards</li>
		<li>Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services, or</li>
		<li>Statements on Standards for Tax Services</li>
	</ol>


<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .04</b>An attestation engagement may be part of a larger engagement, for
example, a feasibility study or business acquisition study that also includes an examination of prospective financial information. In such circumstances, the
attestation standards apply only to the attestation portion of the engagement.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compliance With the Attestation Standards</b>
<p id="aud570a01">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05 </b>The "Compliance With Standards Rule" (ET sec. 1.310.001) of the
AICPA Code of Professional Conduct requires members who perform professional
services to comply with standards promulgated by bodies designated by
the Council of the AICPA.
</p></p>
<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relationship of Attestation Standards to Quality
Control Standards</b>
<b>.06</b> Quality control systems, policies, and procedures are the responsibility
of the firm in conducting its attestation practice. Under QC section 10, A Firm's
System of Quality Control, the firm has an obligation to establish and maintain
a system of quality control to provide it with reasonable assurance that5 (Ref:
par. .A4–.A6)</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>the firm and its personnel comply with professional standards
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and</li>
<li>practitioners' reports issued by the firm are appropriate in the
circumstances.</li>

</ol>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07 </b>Attestation standards relate to the conduct of individual attestation
engagements; quality control standards relate to the conduct of a firm's attestation
practice as a whole. Thus, attestation standards and quality control standards
are related, and the quality control policies and procedures that a firm
adopts may affect both the conduct of individual attestation engagements and
the conduct of a firm's attestation practice as a whole. However, deficiencies in
or instances of noncompliance with a firm's quality control policies and procedures
do not, in and of themselves, indicate that a particular engagement was
not performed in accordance with the attestation standards.</p></br>

	<li>report on the subject matter or assertion, and communicate as
required by the applicable AT-C section, in accordance with the

that provide the practitioner with reasonable assurance that
the attestation engagement complies with professional standards
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</li>

<p>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conduct of an Attestation Engagement in Accordance With the
Attestation Standards</b>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Complying With AT-C Sections That Are Relevant to the Engagement</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12 </b>When performing an attestation engagement, the practitioner should
comply with
<ul>
	<li>athis section;</li>
<li>sections 205, 210, or 215, as applicable; and</li>
<li>has disclosed to the auditor its knowledge of fraud or suspected
fraud affecting the entity involving</li>
<li>any subject-matter AT-C section relevant to the engagement when
the AT-C section is in effect and the circumstances addressed by
the AT-C section exist.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.13 </b> The practitioner should not represent compliance with this or any
other AT-C section unless the practitioner has complied with the requirements
of this section and all other AT-C sections relevant to the engagement.</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.14 </b>Reports issued by a practitioner in connection with services performed
under other professional standards should be written to be clearly distinguishable
from and not confused with reports issued under the attestation standards.
(Ref: par. .A19–.A20)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Text of an AT-C Section</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.15 </b>The practitioner should have an understanding of the entire text of
each AT-C section that is relevant to the engagement being performed, including
its application and other explanatory material, to understand its objectives
and apply its requirements properly. (Ref: par. .A21–.A26)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Complying With Relevant Requirements</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16 </b>Subject to paragraph .20, the practitioner should comply with each requirement
of the AT-C sections that is relevant to the engagement being performed,
including any relevant subject-matter AT-C section, unless, in the circumstances
of the engagement,
<ol type="a">
	<li> the entire AT-C section is not relevant, or</li>
	<li> the requirement is not relevant because it is conditional, and the condition does not exist.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.17 </b>When a practitioner undertakes an attestation engagement for the
benefit of a government body or agency and agrees to follow specified government
standards, guides, procedures, statutes, rules, and regulations, the practitioner
should comply with those governmental requirements as well as the
applicable AT-C sections. (Ref: par. .A27)
<ol type="a">
	<li>it has disclosed to the auditor the identity of the entity's related
parties and all the related party relationships and transactions
of which it is aware and</li>
<li>it has appropriately accounted for and disclosed such relationships
and transactions.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Practitioner’s Report Prescribed by Law or Regulation</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.18 </b>If the practitioner is required by law or regulation to use a specific
layout, form, or wording of the practitioner's report and the prescribed form of
report is not acceptable or would cause a practitioner to make a statement that
the practitioner has no basis to make, the practitioner should reword the prescribed
form of report or attach an appropriately worded separate practitioner's
report. (Ref: par. .A28)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Defining Professional Requirements in the Attestation Standards</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.19 </b>TThe attestation standards use the following two categories of professional
requirements, identified by specific terms, to describe the degree of responsibility
it imposes on practitioners:
<ul>
	<li><i>Unconditional requirements.</i>The practitioner must comply with
an unconditional requirement in all cases in which such requirement
is relevant. The attestation standards use the word must to
indicate an unconditional requirement.</li>
</ul>
<li><i>Presumptively mandatory requirements.</i>The practitioner must
comply with a presumptively mandatory requirement in all cases
in which such a requirement is relevant, except in rare circumstances
discussed in paragraph .20. The attestation standards use
the word should to indicate a presumptively mandatory requirement.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Departure From a Relevant Requirement</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.20 </b>In rare circumstances, the practitioner may judge it necessary to depart
from a relevant presumptively mandatory requirement. In such circumstances,
the practitioner should perform alternative procedures to achieve the
intent of that requirement. The need for the practitioner to depart from a relevant,
presumptively mandatory requirement is expected to arise only when
the requirement is for a specific procedure to be performed and, in the specific
circumstances of the engagement, that procedure would be ineffective in
achieving the intent of the requirement. (Ref: par. .A29)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interpretive Publications</b></p>


<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.21 </b>The practitioner should consider applicable interpretive publications
in planning and performing the attestation engagement. (Ref: par. .A30)</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Other Attestation Publications</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.22 </b>In applying the attestation guidance included in an other attestation
publication, the practitioner should, exercising professional judgment, assess
the relevance and appropriateness of such guidance to the circumstances of
the attestation engagement. (Ref: par. .A31–.A33)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Acceptance and Continuance</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.23 </b>The engagement partner should be satisfied that appropriate procedures
regarding the acceptance and continuance of client relationships and
attestation engagements have been followed and should determine that conclusions
reached in this regard are appropriate</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Preconditions for an Attestation Engagement</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.24 </b>The practitioner must be independent when performing an attestation
engagement in accordance with the attestation standards unless the practitioner
is required by law or regulation to accept the engagement and report on
the subject matter or assertion. (Ref: par. .A34)</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.25 </b>In order to establish that the preconditions for an attestation engagement
are present, the practitioner should determine both of the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The responsible party is a party other than the practitioner and
takes responsibility for the subject matter. (Ref: par. .A35)</li>
<li>The engagement exhibits all of the following characteristics:</li>

<ol type="i">
	<li>The subject matter is appropriate. (Ref: par. .A36–.A41)</li>
	<li>The criteria to be applied in the preparation and evaluation
of the subject matter are suitable and will be available
to the intended users. (Ref: par. .A43–.A52)</li>
<li>The practitioner expects to be able to obtain the evidence
needed to arrive at the practitioner's opinion, conclusion,
or findings, including (Ref: par. .A53–.A54)</li>
<ol type="1">
	<li>access to all information of which the responsible
party is aware that is relevant to the measurement,
evaluation, or disclosure of the subject matter;</li>
<li>access to additional information that the practitioner
may request from the responsible party for
the purpose of the engagement; and</li>
<li>unrestricted access to persons within the appropriate
party(ies) from whom the practitioner determines
it necessary to obtain evidence.</li>
</ol>
<li> The practitioner's opinion, conclusion, or findings, in the
form appropriate to the engagement, is to be contained in
a written practitioner's report.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.26 </b>If the preconditions in paragraphs .24–.25 are not present, the practitioner
should discuss the matter with the engaging party to attempt to resolve
the issue.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.27 </b>The practitioner should accept an attestation engagement only when
the practitioner</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>has no reason to believe that relevant ethical requirements, including
independence, will not be satisfied;</li>
<li>is satisfied that those persons who are to perform the engagement
collectively have the appropriate competence and capabilities (see
also paragraph .32);</li>
<li>has determined that the engagement to be performed meets all
the preconditions for an attestation engagement (see also paragraphs
.24–.25); and</li>
<li>has reached a common understanding with the engaging party of
the terms of the engagement, including the practitioner's reporting
responsibilities</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.28 </b>If it is discovered after the engagement has been accepted that one
or more of the preconditions for an attestation engagement is not present,
the practitioner should discuss the matter with the appropriate party(ies) and
should determine
<ol type="a">
	<li>whether the matter can be resolved;</li>
	<li>whether it is appropriate to continue with the engagement; and</li>
<li>if the matter cannot be resolved but it is still appropriate to continue
with the engagement, whether, and if so how, to communicate
the matter in the practitioner's report.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acceptance of a Change in the Terms of the Engagement</b></p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.29 </b>The practitioner should not agree to a change in the terms of the
engagement when no reasonable justification for doing so exists. If a change in the terms of the engagement is made, the practitioner should not disregard
evidence that was obtained prior to the change. (Ref: par. .A55–.A56)</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.30 </b>If the practitioner concludes, based on the practitioner's professional
judgment, that there is reasonable justification to change the terms of the engagement
from the original level of service that the practitioner was engaged to
perform to a lower level of service, for example, from an examination to a review,
and if the practitioner complies with the AT-C sections applicable to the lower
level of service, the practitioner should issue an appropriate practitioner's report
on the lower level of service. The report should not include reference to (a)
the original engagement, (b) any procedures that may have been performed, or
(c) scope limitations that resulted in the changed engagement.</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the Work of an Other Practitioner</b></p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.31 </b>When the practitioner expects to use the work of an other practitioner,
the practitioner should (Ref: par. .A57–.A58).
<ol type="a">
	<li>obtain an understanding of whether the other practitioner understands
and will comply with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to the engagement and, in particular, is independent.</li>
<li>obtain an understanding of the other practitioner's professional
competence.</li>
<li>communicate clearly with the other practitioner about the scope
and timing of the other practitioner's work and findings.</li>
<li>if assuming responsibility for the work of the other practitioner,
be involved in the work of the other practitioner</li>
<li>evaluate whether the other practitioner's work is adequate for the
practitioner's purposes.</li>
<li>determine whether to make reference to the other practitioner in
the practitioner's report.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quality Control</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Assignment of the Engagement Team and the Practitioner’s Specialists</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.32</b>The engagement partner should be satisfied that
<ol type="a">
	<li>the engagement team, and any practitioner's external specialists,
collectively, have the appropriate competence, including knowledge
of the subject matter, and capabilities to (Ref: par. .A59–.A60)</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li> perform the engagement in accordance with professional
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements
and</li>
<li> enable the issuance of a practitioner's report that is appropriate
in the circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<li>to an extent that is sufficient to accept responsibility for the opinion,
conclusion, or findings on the subject matter or assertion, the
engagement team will be able to be involved in the work of</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li>. a practitioner's external specialist when the work of that
specialist is to be used and (Ref: par. .A61)</li>
<li>an other practitioner, when the work of that practitioner
is to be used.</li>
</ol>
<li>those involved in the engagement have been informed of their responsibilities,
including the objectives of the procedures they are
to perform and matters that may affect the nature, timing, and
extent of such procedures.</li>
<li>engagement team members have been directed to bring to the engagement
partner's attention significant questions raised during

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leadership Responsibilities for Quality in Attestation Engagements</b></p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.33</b>The engagement partner should take responsibility for the overall
quality on each attestation engagement. This includes responsibility for the
following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>Appropriate procedures being performed regarding the acceptance
and continuance of client relationships and engagements</li>
<li>The engagement being planned and performed (including appropriate
direction and supervision) to comply with professional
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements</li>
<li>Reviews being performed in accordance with the firm's review
policies and procedures and reviewing the engagement documentation
on or before the date of the practitioner's report (Ref: par.
.A62)</li>
<li>Appropriate engagement documentation being maintained to provide
evidence of achievement of the practitioner's objectives and
that the engagement was performed in accordance with the attestation
standards and relevant legal and regulatory requirements</li>
<li>Appropriate consultation being undertaken by the engagement
team on difficult or contentious matters
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Engagement Documentation</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.34</b>The practitioner should prepare engagement documentation on a
timely basis. (Ref: par. .A63)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.35</b>The practitioner should assemble the engagement documentation in
an engagement file and complete the administrative process of assembling the
final engagement file no later than 60 days following the practitioner's report
release date. (Ref: par. .A64)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.36</b>After the documentation completion date, the practitioner should not
delete or discard documentation of any nature before the end of its retention
period.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.37</b>If the practitioner finds it necessary to amend existing engagement
documentation or add new engagement documentation after the documentation
completion date, the practitioner should, regardless of the nature of the
amendments or additions, document
<ol type="a">
	<li>the specific reasons for making the amendments or additions and</li>
	<li>when, and by whom, they were made and reviewed.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.38</b>Engagement documentation is the property of the practitioner, and
some jurisdictions recognize this right of ownership in their statutes. The practitioner
should adopt reasonable procedures to retain engagement documentation
for a period of time sufficient to meet the needs of the practitioner and to
satisfy any applicable legal or regulatory requirements for records retention.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.39</b>Because engagement documentation often contains confidential information,
the practitioner should adopt reasonable procedures to maintain the
confidentiality of that information.</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.40</b>Relevant information may include such matters as the following:
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.41</b>The practitioner also should adopt reasonable procedures to prevent
unauthorized access to engagement documentation.</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Engagement Quality Control Review</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.42</b>For those engagements, if any, for which the firm has determined that
an engagement quality control review is required (Ref: par. .A65)
<ol type="a">
	<li>the engagement partner should take responsibility for discussing
with the engagement quality control reviewer significant findings
or issues arising during the engagement, including those identified
during the engagement quality control review, and not release
the practitioner's report until completion of the engagement quality
control review and</li>
<li>the engagement quality control reviewer should perform an objective
evaluation of the significant judgments made by the engagement
team and the conclusions reached in formulating the
report. This evaluation should include the following:</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li> Discussion of significant findings or issues with the engagement
partner</li>
<li>Reading the written subject matter or assertion and the
proposed report</li>
<li>Reading selected engagement documentation relating to
the significant judgments the engagement team made and
the related conclusions it reached</li>
<li>Evaluation of the conclusions reached in formulating the
report and consideration of whether the proposed report is
appropriate</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Professional Skepticism and Professional Judgment</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Professional Skepticism</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.43</b>The practitioner should plan and perform an attestation engagement
with professional skepticism. (Ref: par. .A66–.A68)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.44</b>Unless the practitioner has reason to believe the contrary, the practitioner
may accept records and documents as genuine. If conditions identified
during the attestation engagement cause the practitioner to believe that a document
may not be authentic or that terms in a document have been modified
but not disclosed to the practitioner, the practitioner should investigate further.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Professional Judgment</i></b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.45</b>The practitioner should exercise professional judgment in planning
and performing an attestation engagement. (Ref: par. .A69–.A74)</p>
