<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ylyil">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03.</b>  A report issued in accordance with the provisions of this section does not provide a legal determination of an entity's compliance with specified requirements. However, such a report may be useful to legal counsel or others in making such determinations.
</p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="compa1">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of Services </b>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="nrkpz">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04.</b>  The practitioner may be engaged to perform agreed-upon procedures to assist users in evaluating the following subject matter (or assertions related thereto) -


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The entity's compliance with specified requirements
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The effectiveness of the entity's internal control over compliance <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 3</sup>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Both the entity's compliance with specified requirements and the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over compliance
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The practitioner also may be engaged to examine the entity's compliance with specified requirements or a written assertion thereon.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="drion">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05.</b>  An important consideration in determining the type of engagement to be performed is expectations by users of the practitioner's report. Since the users decide the procedures to be performed in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, it often will be in the best interests of the practitioner and users (including the client) to have an agreed-upon procedures engagement rather than an examination engagement. When deciding whether to accept an examination engagement, the practitioner should consider the risks discussed in paragraphs .31 through .35.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="vahqo">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06.</b>  A practitioner may be engaged to examine the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over compliance or an assertion thereon. However, in accordance with section 50, the practitioner cannot accept an engagement unless he or she has reason to believe that the subject matter is capable of reasonably consistent evaluation against criteria that are suitable and available to users.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 4</sup>  If a practitioner determines that such criteria do exist for internal control over compliance, he or she should perform the engagement in accordance with section 101, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attest Engagements</i>. Additionally, section 501, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An Examination of an Entity's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated With an Audit of Its Financial Statements</i>, may be helpful to a practitioner in such an engagement. [Revised, November 2006, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 14.]
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="xgzgv">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07.</b>  A practitioner should not accept an engagement to perform a review, as defined in section 101.55, of an entity's compliance with specified requirements or about the effectiveness of an entity's internal control over compliance or an assertion thereon.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="slvae">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08.</b>  The practitioner may be engaged to provide other types of services in connection with the entity's compliance with specified requirements or the entity's internal control over compliance. For example, management may engage the practitioner to provide recommendations on how to improve the entity's compliance or related internal control. A practitioner engaged to provide such nonattest services should refer to the guidance in CS section 100, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consulting Services: Definitions and Standards</i>.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conditions for Engagement Performance </b>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="sslpt">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09.</b>  A practitioner may perform an agreed-upon procedures engagement related to an entity's compliance with specified requirements or the effectiveness of internal control over compliance if the following conditions are met.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The responsible party accepts responsibility for the entity's compliance with specified requirements and the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over compliance.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The responsible party evaluates the entity's compliance with specified requirements or the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over compliance.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">See also section 201, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements</i>.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="zshte">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.10.</b>  A practitioner may perform an examination engagement related to an entity's compliance with specified requirements if the following conditions are met.


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The responsible party accepts responsibility for the entity's compliance with specified requirements and the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over compliance.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  The responsible party evaluates the entity's compliance with specified requirements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Sufficient evidential matter exists or could be developed to support management's evaluation.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="amcex">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11.</b>  As part of engagement performance, the practitioner should obtain from the responsible party a written assertion about compliance with specified requirements or internal control over compliance. The responsible party may present its written assertion in either of the following:


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  A separate report that will accompany the practitioner's report
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  A representation letter to the practitioner
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="utlap">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12.</b>  The responsible party's written assertion about compliance with specified requirements or internal control over compliance may take many forms. Throughout this section, for example, the phrase "responsible party's assertion that W Company complied with [<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">specify compliance requirement</i>] as of [<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">date</i>]," illustrates such an assertion. Other phrases may also be used. However, a practitioner should not accept an assertion that is so subjective (for example, "very effective" internal control over compliance) that people having competence in and using the same or similar criteria would not ordinarily be able to arrive at similar conclusions.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="nbokf">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.13.</b>  Regardless of whether the practitioner's client is the responsible party, the responsible party's refusal to furnish a written assertion as part of an examination engagement should cause the practitioner to withdraw from the engagement. However, an exception is provided if an examination of an entity's compliance with specified requirements is required by law or regulation. In that instance, the practitioner should disclaim an opinion on compliance unless he or she obtains evidential matter that warrants expressing an adverse opinion. If the practitioner expresses an adverse opinion and the responsible party does not provide an assertion, the practitioner's report should be restricted as to use. (See section 101.78.81.) If, as part of an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner's client is the responsible party, a refusal by that party to provide an assertion requires the practitioner to withdraw from the engagement. However, withdrawal is not required if the engagement is required by law or regulation. If, in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner's client is not the responsible party, the practitioner is not required to withdraw but should consider the effects of the responsible party's refusal on the engagement and his or her report.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="kqrso">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.14.</b>  Additionally, at the beginning of the engagement, the practitioner may want to consider discussing with the client and the responsible party the need for the responsible party to provide the practitioner with a written representation letter at the conclusion of the examination engagement or an agreed-upon procedures engagement in which the client is the responsible party. In that letter, the responsible party will be asked to provide, among other possible items, an acknowledgment of their responsibility for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance and their assertion stating their evaluation of the entity's compliance with specified requirements. The responsible party's refusal to furnish these representations (see paragraphs .68 through .70) will constitute a limitation on the scope of the engagement.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p>Representation Letter</p>
<b>Consideration of Subsequent Events</b>
<br/>
<b>.50.</b> The practitioner's consideration of subsequent events in an examination of an entity's compliance with specified requirements is similar to the auditor's consideration of subsequent events in a financial statement audit, as outlined in AU-C section 560, <i>Subsequent Events and Subsequently Discovered Facts. </i>The practitioner should consider information about such events that comes to his or her attention after the end of the period addressed by the practitioner's report and prior to the issuance of his or her report. [Revised, December 2012, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SAS Nos. 122–126.].<br/>
<b>.51.</b> Two types of subsequent events require consideration by the responsible party and evaluation by the practitioner. The first consists of events that provide additional information about the entity's compliance during the period addressed by the practitioner's report and may affect the practitioner's report. For the period from the end of the reporting period (or point in time) to the date of the practitioner's report, the practitioner should perform procedures to identify such events that provide additional information about compliance during the reporting period. Such procedures should include but may not be limited to inquiring about and considering the following information:
<ul>
	<li>Relevant internal auditors' reports issued during the subsequent period</li>
	<li>Other practitioners' reports identifying noncompliance, issued during the subsequent period</li>
	<li>Regulatory agencies' reports on the entity's noncompliance, issued during the subsequent period</li>
	<li>Information about the entity's noncompliance, obtained through other professional engagements for that entity</li>
</ul>
<b>.52.</b> The second type consists of noncompliance that occurs subsequent to the period being reported on but before the date of the practitioner's report. The practitioner has no responsibility to detect such noncompliance. However, should the practitioner become aware of such noncompliance, it may be of such a nature and significance that disclosure of it is required to keep users from being misled. In such cases, the practitioner should include in his or her report an explanatory paragraph describing the nature of the noncompliance.
<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at60168">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.68.</b>  In an examination engagement or an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner should obtain written representations from the responsible party - <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 22</sup>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    Acknowledging the responsible party's responsibility for complying with the specified requirements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    Acknowledging the responsible party's responsibility for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.    Stating that the responsible party has performed an evaluation of (1) the entity's compliance with specified requirements or (2) the entity's controls for ensuring compliance and detecting noncompliance with requirements, as applicable.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.    Stating the responsible party's assertion about the entity's compliance with the specified requirements or about the effectiveness of internal control over compliance, as applicable, based on the stated or established criteria.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.    Stating that the responsible party has disclosed to the practitioner all known noncompliance.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.    State that the responsible party has made available all documentation related to compliance with the specified requirements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">g.    Stating the responsible party's interpretation of any compliance requirements that have varying interpretations.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">h.    State that the responsible party has disclosed any communications from regulatory agencies, internal auditors, and other practitioners concerning possible noncompliance with the specified requirements, including communications received between the end of the period addressed in the written assertion and the date of the practitioner's report.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">i.    Stating that the responsible party has disclosed any known noncompliance occurring subsequent to the period for which, or date as of which, the responsible party selects to make its assertion.
</p>

</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="hvjri">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.69.</b>  The responsible party's refusal to furnish all appropriate written representations in an examination engagement constitutes a limitation on the scope of the engagement sufficient to preclude an unqualified opinion and is ordinarily sufficient to cause the practitioner to disclaim an opinion or withdraw from the engagement. However, based on the nature of the representations not obtained or the circumstances of the refusal, the practitioner may conclude in an examination engagement that a qualified opinion is appropriate. When the practitioner is performing agreed-upon procedures and the practitioner's client is the responsible party, the responsible party's refusal to furnish all appropriate written representations constitutes a limitation on the scope of the engagement sufficient to cause the practitioner to withdraw. When the practitioner's client is not the responsible party, the practitioner is not required to withdraw but should consider the effects of the responsible party's refusal on his or her report. Further, the practitioner should consider the effects of the responsible party's refusal on his or her ability to rely on other representations of the responsible party.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="acnuf">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.70.</b>  When the practitioner's client is not the responsible party, the practitioner may also want to obtain written representations from the client. For example, when a practitioner's client has entered into a contract with a third party (responsible party) and the practitioner is engaged to examine the responsible party's compliance with that contract, the practitioner may want to obtain written representations from his or her client as to their knowledge of any noncompliance.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<sup>fn 3</sup>
</b>  An entity's internal control over compliance is the process by which management obtains reasonable assurance of compliance with specified requirements. Although the comprehensive internal control may include a wide variety of objectives and related policies and procedures, only some of these may be relevant to an entity's compliance with specified requirements. (See footnote 1b.) The components of internal control over compliance vary based on the nature of the compliance requirements. For example, internal control over compliance with a capital requirement would generally include accounting procedures, whereas internal control over compliance with a requirement to practice nondiscriminatory hiring may not include accounting procedures.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<sup>fn 4</sup>
</b>  Criteria issued by regulatory agencies and other groups composed of experts that follow due-process procedures, including exposure of the proposed criteria for public comment, ordinarily should be considered suitable criteria for this purpose. For example, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission's Report, Internal Control - Integrated Framework, provides suitable criteria against which management may evaluate and report on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. However, more detailed criteria relative to specific compliance requirements may have to be developed and an appropriate threshold for measuring the severity of control deficiencies needs to be developed in order to apply the concepts of the COSO report to internal control over compliance.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Criteria established by a regulatory agency that does not follow such due-process procedures also may be considered suitable criteria for use by the regulatory agency. The practitioner should determine whether such criteria are suitable for general use reporting by evaluating them against the attributes in section 101.24. If the practitioner determines that such criteria are suitable for general use reporting, those criteria should also be available to users as discussed in section 101.33.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">If the practitioner concludes that the criteria are appropriate only for a limited number of parties or are available only to specified parties, the practitioner's report shall state that the use of the report is restricted to those parties specified in the report. (See section 101.30, .34, and .78-.83.)
