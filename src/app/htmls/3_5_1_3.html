    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Initial Criteria for Classification as Held for Sale </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-9</b> A long-lived asset (disposal group) to be sold shall be
        classified as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met:

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell
        the asset (disposal group).
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. The asset (disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition
        subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (disposal groups). (See Examples 5
        through 7 [paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-55-37 through 55-41</u>], which illustrate
        when that criterion would be met.)
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. An active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan
        to sell the asset (disposal group) have been initiated.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. The sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable, and transfer of the asset
        (disposal group) is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale, within one year, except as
        permitted by paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-45-11</u>. (See Example 8 [paragraph <u
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-55-43</u>], which illustrates when that criterion would be met.)
        The term <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">probable</b> refers to a future sale that is likely to occur.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">e. The asset (disposal group) is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is
        reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The price at which a long-lived asset (disposal group) is
        being marketed is indicative of whether the entity currently has the intent and ability to sell the asset
        (disposal group). A market price that is reasonable in relation to fair value indicates that the asset (disposal
        group) is available for immediate sale, whereas a market price in excess of fair value indicates that the asset
        (disposal group) is not available for immediate sale.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">f. Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant
        changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-10</b> If at any time the criteria in this Subsection are no longer
        met (except as permitted by the following paragraph), a long-lived asset (disposal group) classified as held for
        sale shall be reclassified as held and used in accordance with paragraph <u
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-35-44</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-11</b> Events or circumstances beyond an entity's control may extend
        the period required to complete the sale of a long-lived asset (disposal group) beyond one year. An exception to
        the one-year requirement in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-45-9(d)</u> shall apply in
        the following situations in which such events or circumstances arise:

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. If at the date an entity commits to a plan to sell a long-lived asset (disposal
        group) the entity reasonably expects that others (not a buyer) will impose conditions on the transfer of the
        asset (group) that will extend the period required to complete the sale and both of the following conditions are
        met:

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">1. Actions necessary to respond to those conditions cannot be initiated until after
        a<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">firm purchase commitment</b> is obtained.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">2. A firm purchase commitment is probable within one year. (See Example 9 [paragraph
        <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-55-44</u>], which illustrates that situation.)
    </p>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. If an entity obtains a firm purchase commitment and, as a result, a buyer or others
        unexpectedly impose conditions on the transfer of a long-lived asset (disposal group) previously classified as
        held for sale that will extend the period required to complete the sale and both of the following conditions are
        met:

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">1. Actions necessary to respond to the conditions have been or will be timely
        initiated.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">2. A favorable resolution of the delaying factors is expected. (See Example 10
        [paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-55-46</u>], which illustrates that situation.)
    </p>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. If during the initial one-year period, circumstances arise that previously were
        considered unlikely and, as a result, a long-lived asset (disposal group) previously classified as held for sale
        is not sold by the end of that period and all of the following conditions are met:

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">1. During the initial one-year period the entity initiated actions necessary to
        respond to the change in circumstances.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">2. The asset (group) is being actively marketed at a price that is reasonable given
        the change in circumstances.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">3. The criteria in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-45-9</u>
        are met. (See Example 11 [paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-55-48</u>], which illustrates
        that situation.)
    </p>

    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Change of Classification After Balance Sheet Date but Before
            Issuance of Financial Statements </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-13</b> If the criteria in paragraph <u
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-45-9</u> are met after the balance sheet date but before the
        financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section <u
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">855-10-25</u>), a long-lived asset shall continue to be classified as
        held and used in those financial statements when issued or when available to be issued. In addition, information
        required by paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">205-20-50-1(a)</u> shall be disclosed in the notes
        to financial statements. If the asset (asset group) is tested for recoverability (on a held-and-used basis) as
        of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test shall consider the likelihood of
        possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date, including the assessment of the likelihood of the
        future sale of the asset. That assessment made as of the balance sheet date shall not be revised for a decision
        to sell the asset after the balance sheet date. Because it is difficult to separate the benefit of hindsight
        when assessing conditions that existed at a prior date, it is important that judgments about those conditions,
        the need to test an asset for recoverability, and the application of a recoverability test be made and
        documented together with supporting evidence on a timely basis. An impairment loss, if any, to be recognized
        shall be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset (asset group) exceeds its fair value
        at the balance sheet date.

        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Presentation of Long-Lived Assets or Disposal Group Classified
            as Held for Sale </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-14</b> A long-lived asset classified as held for sale shall be
        presented separately in the statement of financial position. The presentation requirements in paragraph <u
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">205-20-45-10</u> are also applicable to long-lived assets (disposal
        groups) within the scope of this Subtopic.

            by Sale </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-15</b> A long-lived asset to be disposed of other than by sale (for
        example, by abandonment, in an exchange measured based on the recorded amount of the nonmonetary asset
        relinquished, or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff) shall continue to be classified as held and used
        until it is disposed of. The guidance on long-lived assets to be held and used in Sections <u
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-35, 360-10-45</u>, and <u
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-50</u> shall apply while the asset is classified as held and
        used. If a long-lived asset is to be abandoned or distributed to owners in a spinoff together with other assets
        (and liabilities) as a group and that disposal group is a component of an entity, paragraphs <u
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">205-20-45-1 through 45-5</u> and <u
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">205-20-50-5</u> shall apply to the disposal group at the date it is
