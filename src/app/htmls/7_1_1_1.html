<p class="header">&gt;  Recognition of Liabilities and Assets</p>
</p><p id="71525">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-1</b>  If the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">projected benefit obligation</b> exceeds the fair value of <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">plan assets</b>, the employer shall recognize in its statement of financial position a liability that equals the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">unfunded projected benefit obligation</b>. If the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation, the employer shall recognize in its statement of financial position an asset that equals the overfunded projected benefit obligation.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-2</b>  The employer shall aggregate the statuses of all overfunded plans and recognize that amount as an asset in its statement of financial position. It also shall aggregate the statuses of all underfunded plans and recognize that amount as a liability in its statement of financial position.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-3</b>  The asset or liability that is recognized pursuant to paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-25-1</u> may result in a temporary difference, as defined in Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10</u>. The deferred tax effects of any temporary differences shall be recognized in income tax expense or benefit for the year and shall be allocated to various financial statement components, including other comprehensive income, pursuant to Section <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-20-45</u>.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-4</b>  If a new determination of the funded status of a plan to be recognized as an asset or a liability in the employer's statement of financial position is made (see paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-35-62 through 35-69</u>), or when net gains or losses, prior <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">service</b> costs or credits, or the net transition asset or obligation existing at the date of initial application of this Subtopic are amortized as components of <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">net periodic pension cost</b>, the related balances for those net gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation in accumulated other comprehensive income shall be adjusted as necessary and reported in other comprehensive income.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-5</b>  Sometimes, an entity remeasures both plan assets and benefit obligations during the fiscal year. Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-35-66</u> provides an example of some events that may require a remeasurement. Upon remeasurement, a business entity shall adjust its statement of financial position in a subsequent interim period to reflect the overfunded or underfunded status of the plan consistent with that measurement date.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-6</b>  An employer that sponsors two or more separate defined benefit pension plans shall determine net periodic pension cost, liabilities, and assets by separately applying the provisions of this Subtopic to each plan. In particular, unless an employer clearly has a right to use the assets of one plan to pay <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">benefits</b> of another, a liability required to be recognized pursuant to paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-25-1</u> for one plan shall not be reduced or eliminated because the employer has recognized an asset for another plan that has assets in excess of its projected benefit obligation.

<p class="header">Settlements, Curtailments, and Certain Termination Benefits</p>
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Certain Termination Benefits</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-8</b>  This Subsection addresses the accounting for termination benefits that are not otherwise addressed in the Subtopic and Topics indicated in paragraph 715-30-15-6c.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-9</b>  An employer may provide benefits to employees in connection with their termination of employment.  Those benefits may be either special termination benefits offered only for a short period of time or contractual termination benefits required by the terms of a plan only if a specified event, such as a plant closing, causes employee's services to be terminated involuntarily.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-10</b>  Termination benefits may take various forms including lump-sum payments, periodic future payments, or both.  They may be paid directly from an employer's assets, an existing pension plan, a new employee benefit plan, or a combination of those means.  An employer that offers special termination benefits to employees shall recognize a liability and a loss when the employees accept the offer and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  An employer that provides contractual termination benefits shall recognize a liability and a loss when it is probable that employees will be entitled to benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">25-11</b>  The cost of termination benefits within the scope of this Subsection recognized as a liability and a loss shall include the amount of any lump-sum payments and the present value of any expected future payments.  The liability and the loss from acceptance of the offer of special termination benefits is the difference as of the date the employees accept the offer between the actuarial present value of the respective employees' accumulated pension benefits without considering the special termination benefits and the actuarial present value of their accumulated pension benefits considering the special termination benefits.</p><table border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0"></table></p>
