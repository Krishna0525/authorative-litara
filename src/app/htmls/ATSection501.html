<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="opin01">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forming an Opinion</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="opin1">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.93</b>  The auditor should form an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control by evaluating evidence obtained from all sources, including the auditor's testing of controls, misstatements detected during the financial statement audit, and any identified deficiencies. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="opin2">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .94</b>   As part of this evaluation, the auditor should review reports issued during the year by internal audit (or similar functions) that address controls related to internal control and evaluate deficiencies identified in those reports.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="opin3">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.95</b>   After forming an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control, the auditor should evaluate management's report to determine whether it appropriately contains the following: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">A statement regarding management's responsibility for internal control
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">A description of the subject matter of the examination (for example, controls over the preparation of the entity's financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles [GAAP])
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">An identification of the criteria against which internal control is measured (for example, criteria established in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Internal Control - Integrated Framework</i>)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Management's assertion about the effectiveness of internal control 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">A description of the material weaknesses, if any
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The date as of which management's assertion is made 
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="opin4">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.96</b>   If the auditor determines that any required element of management's report is incomplete or improperly presented, the auditor should request management to revise its report. If management does not revise its report, the auditor should apply  paragraph .116. If management refuses to furnish a report, the auditor should apply  paragraph .13.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="opin8">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obtaining Written Representations </b>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="opin5">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.97</b>  In an examination of internal control, the auditor should obtain written representations from management

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  acknowledging management's responsibility for establishing and maintaining effective internal control; 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  stating that management has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the entity's internal control and specifying the control criteria; 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  stating that management did not use the auditor's procedures performed during the integrated audit as part of the basis for management's assertion; 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  stating management's assertion about the effectiveness of the entity's internal control based on the control criteria as of a specified date; 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  stating that management has disclosed to the auditor all deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control, including separately disclosing to the auditor all such deficiencies that it believes to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control; 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.  describing any fraud resulting in a material misstatement to the entity's financial statements and any other fraud that does not result in a material misstatement to the entity's financial statements, but involves senior management or management or other employees who have a significant role in the entity's internal control; 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">g.  stating whether the significant deficiencies and material weaknesses identified and communicated to management and those charged with governance during previous engagements pursuant to  paragraph .100 have been resolved and specifically identifying any that have not; and 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">h.  stating whether there were, subsequent to the date being reported on, any changes in internal control or other factors that might significantly affect internal control, including any corrective actions taken by management with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="opin6">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.98</b>  The failure to obtain written representations from management, including management's refusal to furnish them, constitutes a limitation on the scope of the examination.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 25</sup> The auditor should evaluate the effects of management's refusal on his or her ability to rely on other representations, such as those obtained in the audit of the entity's financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="opin7">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.99</b>  The auditor should apply  AU section 333, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management Representations</i>, as it relates to matters such as who should sign the letter, the period to be covered by the letter, and when to obtain an updated letter.
</p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Communicating Certain Matters</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at501100">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.100  </b>Deficiencies identified during the integrated audit that, upon evaluation, are considered significant deficiencies or material weaknesses should be communicated, in writing, to management and those charged with governance as a part of each integrated audit, including significant deficiencies and material weaknesses that were previously communicated to management and those charged with governance and have not yet been remediated. Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses that previously were communicated and have not yet been remediated may be communicated, in writing, by referring to the previously issued written communication and the date of that communication. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.101  </b>If the auditor concludes that the oversight of the entity's financial reporting and internal control by the audit committee (or similar subgroups with different names) is ineffective, the auditor should communicate that conclusion, in writing, to the board of directors or other similar governing body if one exists.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.102  </b>The written communications referred to in paragraphs .100-.101should be made by the report release date,<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 26</sup> which is the date the auditor grants the entity permission to use the auditor's report. For a governmental entity, the auditor is not required to make the written communications by the report release date, if such written communications would be publicly available prior to management's report on internal control, the entity's financial statements, and the auditor's report thereon. In that circumstance, the written communications should be made as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days following the report release date. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.103  </b>Because of the importance of timely communication, the auditor may choose to communicate significant matters during the course of the integrated audit. If the communication is made during the integrated audit, the form of interim communication would be affected by the relative significance of the identified deficiencies and the urgency for corrective follow-up action. Such early communication is not required to be in writing. However, regardless of how the early communication is delivered, the auditor should communicate all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in writing to management and those charged with governance in accordance with paragraphs .100-.102, even if the significant deficiencies or material weaknesses were remediated during the examination.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.104  </b>The auditor also should communicate to management, in writing, all deficiencies (those deficiencies that are not material weaknesses or significant deficiencies) identified during the integrated audit on a timely basis, but no later than 60 days following the report release date, and inform those charged with governance when such a communication was made. In making the written communication referred to in this paragraph, the auditor is not required to communicate those deficiencies that are not material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that were included in previous written communications, whether those communications were made by the auditor, internal auditors, or others within the organization.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.105  </b>The auditor is not required to perform procedures that are sufficient to identify all deficiencies; rather, the auditor communicates deficiencies of which he or she is aware.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.106  </b>Because the integrated audit does not provide the auditor with assurance that he or she has identified all deficiencies less severe than a material weakness, the auditor should not issue a report stating that no such deficiencies were identified during the integrated audit. Also, because the auditor's objective in an examination of internal control is to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control, the auditor should not issue a report indicating that no material weaknesses were identified during the integrated audit.
