<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement on Standards for
Tax Services No. 2, Answers to
Questions on Returns</b>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. </b>This statement sets forth the applicable standards for members
when signing the preparers declaration on a tax return if one or
more questions on the return have not been answered. The term questions
includes requests for information on the return, in the instructions,
or in the regulations, whether or not stated in the form of a
question.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statement</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. </b>A member should make a reasonable effort to obtain from the
taxpayer the information necessary to provide appropriate answers to
all questions on a tax return before signing as preparer.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Explanation</b>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. </b>It is recognized that the questions on tax returns are not of
uniform importance, and often they are not applicable to the particular
taxpayer. Nevertheless, there are at least three reasons why a
member should be satisfied that a reasonable effort has been made to
obtain information to provide appropriate answers to the questions on
the return that are applicable to a taxpayer:
<ol type="a">
	<li>A question may be of importance in determining taxable income
or loss, or the tax liability shown on the return, in which
circumstance an omission may detract from the quality of the
return.</li>
<li>A request for information may require a disclosure necessary
for a complete return or to avoid penalties</li>
<li>A member often must sign a preparers declaration stating
that the return is true, correct, and complete.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. </b>Reasonable grounds may exist for omitting an answer to a
question applicable to a taxpayer. For example, reasonable grounds
may include the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The information is not readily available and the answer is not
significant in terms of taxable income or loss, or the tax liability
shown on the return.</li>
<li>Genuine uncertainty exists regarding the meaning of the
question in relation to the particular return.</li>
<li>The answer to the question is voluminous; in such cases, a
statement should be made on the return that the data will be
supplied upon examination</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. </b>A member should not omit an answer merely because it might
prove disadvantageous to a taxpayer.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. </b>A member should consider whether the omission of an answer
to a question may cause the return to be deemed incomplete or result
in penalties.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7. </b>If reasonable grounds exist for omission of an answer to an
applicable question, a taxpayer is not required to provide on the return
an explanation of the reason for the omission.
