				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09</b> Although the objectives of an audit of ICFR and an audit of financial
					statements are not the same, the auditor should plan and perform the integrated
					audit to achieve their respective objectives simultaneously. The auditor
					should design tests of controls </p>
					<ol type="a">

				</li>	
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11</b> The auditor should consider the effect of the results of the financial

				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12</b> If, during the audit of ICFR, the auditor identifies a deficiency in ICFR,
					the auditor should determine the effect of the deficiency, if any, on the nature,
					timing, and extent of substantive procedures to be performed to reduce audit
					risk in the audit of the financial statements to an acceptably low level. See

			<ul style="list-style-type:none">
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.15</b> The auditor should focus more attention on areas of higher risk. A direct
					relationship exists between the degree of risk that a material weakness
					could exist in a particular area of the entity's ICFR and the amount of attention
					that would be devoted to that area. In addition, an entity's ICFR is less
					likely to prevent, or detect and correct, a misstatement caused by fraud than a
					misstatement caused by error. It is not necessary to test controls that, even if
					deficient, would not present a reasonable possibility of material misstatement

			<ul style="list-style-type:none">
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.44</b> For purposes of forming an opinion on the effectiveness of ICFR, the
					auditor should evaluate the severity of each deficiency in ICFR to determine
					whether the deficiency, individually or in combination, is a material weakness
					as of the date specified in management's assessment about ICFR. In performing
					such evaluation, the auditor should determine whether deficiencies that
					affect the same significant class of transactions, account balance, or disclosure;
					relevant assertion; or component of ICFR, collectively result in a material weakness.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.45</b> The auditor should evaluate the effect of compensating controls when
					determining whether a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in ICFR is a
					material weakness as of the date specified in management's assessment about
					ICFR. The auditor should test the operating effectiveness of such compensating
					controls to determine whether they operate at a level of precision that would
					prevent, or detect and correct, a material misstatement.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.46</b> If the auditor initially determines that a deficiency, or a combination
					of deficiencies, in ICFR is not a material weakness, the auditor should consider
					whether prudent officials, having knowledge of the same facts and circumstances,

					or conditions that might significantly affect ICFR subsequent to the as of date
					but before the date of the auditor's report. To obtain additional information
					about changes in ICFR or other conditions that might significantly affect the
					effectiveness of the entity's ICFR, the auditor should inquire about and read,

					<ol type="a">
						<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></b>Relevant internal audit (or similar functions, such as loan review

					knowledge about a material weakness that existed as of the date specified in
					management's assessment about ICFR, the auditor should issue an adverse
					opinion, as required by paragraph .68. The auditor should also follow paragraph
					.72 if management's assessment about ICFR states that ICFR is effective.
					If the auditor is unable to determine the effect of the subsequent event on
					the effectiveness of the entity's ICFR as of the date specified in management's
					assessment about ICFR, the auditor should disclaim an opinion. The auditor
					should disclaim an opinion on management's disclosures about corrective actions
					taken by the entity, if any.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.50</b> If the auditor obtains knowledge about conditions that did not exist at
					the as of date but arose subsequent to that date and before the release of the
					auditor's report and such subsequent information has a material effect on the
					entity's ICFR, the auditor should include in the auditor's report an emphasis-ofmatter

					paragraph describing the subsequently discovered fact and its effects. </p>
				</li>
				<li><p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.51</b> The auditor has no responsibility to keep informed of events subsequent
