<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .01 </b> This section contains performance and reporting requirements and application
guidance for all review engagements. The requirements and guidance
in this section supplement the requirements and guidance in section 105, Concepts
Common to All Attestation Engagements</i></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective Date</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .02 </b> This section is effective for practitioners' review reports dated on or
after May 1, 2017.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objectives</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .03</b> In conducting a review engagement, the objectives of the practitioner
are to
<ol type="a">
	<li>obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications
should be made to the subject matter in order for it to be in
accordance with (or based on) the criteria;</li>
<li>express a conclusion in a written report about whether the practitioner
is aware of any material modifications that should be made
to</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li> the subject matter in order for it to be in accordance with
(or based on) the criteria or</li>
<li>the responsible party's assertion in order for it to be fairly
stated; and</li>
</ol>
<li>communicate further as required by relevant AT-C sections.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definitions</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .04</b> For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
attributed as follows:
<p><b>Appropriateness of review evidence.</b> The measure of the quality
of review evidence, that is, its relevancy and reliability in providing
support for the practitioner's conclusion.	</p>
<p>	<b>Review evidence.</b>Information used by the practitioner in obtaining
limited assurance on which the practitioner's review report is
based.</p>
<p><b>Sufficiency of review evidence.</b> The measure of the quantity of
review evidence. The quantity of the review evidence needed is
affected by the risks of material misstatement and also by the
quality of such evidence.</p>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requirements</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conduct of a Review Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .05</b> In performing a review engagement, the practitioner should comply
with this section, section 105, and any subject-matter AT-C section that is relevant
to the engagement. A subject-matter AT-C section is relevant to the engagement
when it is in effect, and the circumstances addressed by the AT-C
section exist. (Ref: par. .A1)</br>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .06</b> The practitioner should consider whether the nature of review procedures
would enable the practitioner to obtain sufficient appropriate review
evidence to obtain limited assurance. (Ref: par. .A2)</br>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .07</b> A practitioner should not perform a review of (Ref: par. .A2)
<ol type="a">
	<li>prospective financial information,</li>
	<li>internal control, or</li>
	<li>compliance with requirements of specified laws, regulations,
rules, contracts, or grants.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agreeing on the Terms of the Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .08</b> The practitioner should agree upon the terms of the engagement with the engaging party. The agreed-upon terms of the engagement should be specified in sufficient detail in an engagement letter or other suitable form of written agreement. (Ref: par. .A3)</br>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .09</b> The agreed-upon terms of the engagement should include the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The objective and scope of the engagement</li>
	<li>The responsibilities of the practitioner (Ref: par. .A4)</li>
	<li>A statement that the engagement will be conducted in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants</li>
	<li>The responsibilities of the responsible party and the responsibilities
of the engaging party, if different</li>
	<li>A statement that a review is substantially less in scope than an
examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the subject matter is in accordance with (or
based on) the criteria, in all material respects, or the assertion is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion,
and that, accordingly, the practitioner will not express such
an opinion</li>
	<li>Identification of the criteria for the measurement, evaluation, or
disclosure of the subject matter</li>
	<li>An acknowledgement that the engaging party agrees to provide
the practitioner with a representation letter at the conclusion of
the engagement</li>
</ol>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .10</b> Although an engagement may recur, each engagement is considered a
separate engagement. The practitioner should assess whether circumstances
require revision to the terms of a preceding engagement. If the practitioner
concludes that the terms of the preceding engagement need not be revised for
the current engagement, the practitioner should remind the engaging party of
the terms of the current engagement, and the reminder should be documented.
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requesting a Written Assertion</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .11</b> The practitioner should request from the responsible party a written
assertion about the measurement or evaluation of the subject matter against
the criteria. When the engaging party is the responsible party and refuses to
provide a written assertion, paragraph .59 requires the practitioner to withdraw
from the engagement, when withdrawal is possible under applicable laws
and regulations. When the engaging party is not the responsible party, and the
responsible party refuses to provide a written assertion, the practitioner need
not withdraw from the engagement. In that case, paragraph .60 requires the
practitioner to disclose that refusal in the practitioner's report and restrict the
use of the report to the engaging party. (Ref: par. .A5–.A8 and .A76)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Planning and Performing the Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .12</b> The practitioner should set the scope, timing, and direction of the engagement
and determine the nature, timing, and extent of the planned procedures
that are required to be carried out in order to achieve the objectives of
the engagement. (Ref: par. .A9–.A12) </br>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .13</b> The practitioner should obtain an understanding of the subject matter
and other engagement circumstances sufficient to provide a basis for designing
and performing procedures in order to achieve the objectives of the engagement.
That understanding should include the practices used to measure, recognize,
and record the subject matter. (Ref: par. .A13)
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Materiality in Planning and Performing the Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .14</b> The practitioner should consider materiality when (Ref: par. .A14–.A19)
<ul>
	<li>planning and performing the review engagement, including when
determining the nature, timing, and extent of procedures.</li>
<li>evaluating whether the practitioner is aware of any material modifications
that should be made to the subject matter in order for it
to be in accordance with (or based on) the criteria or the assertion
in order for it to be fairly stated.</li>
</ul>
 </p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Procedures to Be Performed</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .15</b> To obtain limited assurance, the practitioner should obtain sufficient
appropriate review evidence in order to express a conclusion about whether any
material modifications should be made to the subject matter in order for it to
be in accordance with (or based on) the criteria, or the assertion, in order for it
to be fairly stated </br>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .16</b> The practitioner should apply professional judgment in determining
the specific nature, timing, and extent of review procedures. Based on (Ref: par.
.A20–.A23)</br>
<ol type="a">
	<li>the practitioner's understanding of</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li> the subject matter and the practices used by the responsible
party to measure, recognize, and record the subject
matter and</li>
		<li> the engagement circumstances, and</li>
	</ol>
	<li> the practitioner's awareness of the risk that the practitioner may
unknowingly fail to modify the practitioner's report when the subject
matter is materially misstated,</li>
</ol>
<p>the practitioner should design and perform analytical procedures and make
inquiries and perform other procedures, as appropriate, to accumulate review
evidence in obtaining limited assurance about whether any material modifications
should be made to the subject matter in order for it to be in accordance
with (or based on) the criteria, or the assertion, in order for it to be fairly stated.</p> </br>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .17</b> Analytical procedures may not be possible when the subject matter is
qualitative, rather than quantitative. In those circumstances, the practitioner
should perform other procedures, in addition to inquiries, that provide equivalent
levels of review evidence. (Ref: par. .A24)</br>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .18</b> The practitioner should place increased focus in those areas in which
the practitioner believes there are increased risks that the subject matter may
be materially misstated. (Ref: par. .A25-A26)</br>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analytical Procedures</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .19</b> When designing and performing analytical procedures, the practitioner
should (Ref: par. .A27–.A28)
<ol type="a">
	<li>determine the suitability of particular analytical procedures for
the subject matter, taking into account the practitioner's awareness
of risks;</li>
	<li>evaluate the reliability of data from which the practitioner's expectation
is developed, taking into account the source, comparability,
nature, and relevance of information available; and</li>
	<li>develop an expectation with respect to recorded amounts or ratios.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .20</b> If analytical procedures identify fluctuations or relationships that are
inconsistent with other relevant information or that differ significantly from
expected amounts or ratios, the practitioner should (Ref: par. .A29)
<ol type="a">
	<li>inquire of the responsible party about such differences and</li>
	<li>consider the responses to these inquiries to determine whether
other procedures are necessary in the circumstances.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inquiries and Other Review Procedures</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .21</b> The practitioner should inquire of the responsible party about the following:
(Ref: par. .A30)
<ol type="a">
	<li>Whether the subject matter has been prepared in accordance with
(or based on) the criteria</li>
	<li>The practices used by the responsible party to measure, recognize,
and record the subject matter</li>
	<li>Questions that have arisen in the course of applying the review
procedures</li>
	<li>Communications from regulatory agencies or others, if relevant</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .22</b> The practitioner should consider the reasonableness and consistency
of the responsible party's responses in light of the results of other review procedures
and the practitioner's knowledge of the subject matter, criteria, and
responsible party</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fraud, Laws, and Regulations</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .23</b> The practitioner should make inquiries of appropriate parties to determine
whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected, or alleged</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .24</b> The practitioner should respond appropriately to fraud or suspected
fraud and noncompliance or suspected noncompliance with laws or regulations
affecting the subject matter that is identified during the engagement. (Ref: par.
.A31–.A32)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incorrect, Incomplete, or Otherwise Unsatisfactory Information</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .25</b> During the performance of review procedures, if the practitioner becomes
aware that information coming to the practitioner's attention is incorrect,
incomplete, or otherwise unsatisfactory, the practitioner should request
that the responsible party consider the effect of these matters on the subject
matter and communicate the results of its consideration to the practitioner.
The practitioner should consider the results communicated to the practitioner
by the responsible party and the potential effect, if any, on the practitioner's
report.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .26</b> If the practitioner believes the subject matter may be materially misstated,
the practitioner should perform additional procedures sufficient to obtain
limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be
made to the subject matter in order for it to be in accordance with (or based
on) the criteria or the assertion in order for it to be fairly stated.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the Work of a Practitioner’s Specialist or Internal Auditors</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .27</b> When the practitioner expects to use the work of a practitioner's specialist
or internal auditors, the practitioner should apply the requirements in
section 205, Examination Engagements, and the related application guidance,
as appropriate, for a review engagement.1</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluating the Results of Review Procedures</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .28</b> The practitioner should accumulate misstatements identified during
the engagement, other than those that are clearly trivial. (Ref: par. .A33–.A34)
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .29</b> The practitioner should evaluate the sufficiency and appropriateness
of the review evidence obtained in the context of the engagement and, if necessary,
attempt to obtain further review evidence. The practitioner should consider
all relevant review evidence, regardless of whether it appears to corroborate
or contradict the measurement or evaluation of the subject matter against
the criteria. (Ref: par. .A35–.A37)
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .30</b> If the practitioner concludes that the subject matter is materially misstated
or is unable to obtain review evidence sufficient for limited assurance,
the practitioner should consider the implications for the practitioner's conclusion
in paragraphs .51–.60.
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering Subsequent Events and Subsequently
Discovered Facts</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .31</b> The practitioner should inquire whether the responsible party, and if
different, the engaging party, is aware of any events subsequent to the period
(or point in time) covered by the review engagement up to the date of the practitioner's
report that could have a significant effect on the subject matter or
assertion. If the practitioner becomes aware, through inquiry or otherwise, of
such an event, or any other event that is of such a nature and significance that
its disclosure is necessary to prevent users of the report from being misled,
and information about that event is not adequately disclosed by the responsible
party in the subject matter or in its assertion, the practitioner should take
appropriate action. (Ref: par. .A38–.A40)
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .32</b> The practitioner has no responsibility to perform any procedures regarding
the subject matter or assertion after the date of the practitioner's report.
Nevertheless, the practitioner should respond appropriately to facts that
become known to the practitioner after the date of the report that, had they
been known to the practitioner at that date, may have caused the practitioner
to revise the report. (Ref: par. .A41–.A42)
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written Representations</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .33</b> The practitioner should request from the responsible party written
representations in the form of a letter addressed to the practitioner. The representations
should (Ref: par. .A43–.A46)
<ol type="a">
	<li>include the responsible party's assertion about the subject matter
based on the criteria. (Ref: par. .A76)</li>
	<li>state that all relevant matters are reflected in the measurement
or evaluation of the subject matter or assertion</li>
	<li>state that all known matters contradicting the subject matter or
assertion and any communication from regulatory agencies or
others affecting the subject matter or assertion have been disclosed
to the practitioner, including communications received between
the end of the period addressed in the written assertion
and the date of the practitioner's report.</li>
	<li>acknowledge responsibility for</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li> the subject matter and the assertion;</li>
		<li> selecting the criteria, when applicable; and</li>
		<li>determining that such criteria are appropriate for the responsible
party's purposes</li>
	</ol>
	<li>state that any known events subsequent to the period (or point in
time) of the subject matter being reported on that would have a
material effect on the subject matter or assertion have been disclosed
to the practitioner. (Ref: par. .A45)</li>
	<li>state that it has provided the practitioner with all relevant information
and access</li>
	<li>if applicable, state that the responsible party believes the effects
of uncorrected misstatements are immaterial, individually and in
the aggregate, to the subject matter. (Ref: par. .A46)</li>
	<li>if applicable, state that significant assumptions used in making
any material estimates are reasonable.</li>
	<li>state that the responsible party has disclosed to the practitioner</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li>all deficiencies in internal control relevant to the engagement
of which the responsible party is aware;</li>
		<li> its knowledge of any actual, suspected, or alleged fraud
or noncompliance with laws or regulations affecting the
subject matter; and</li>
		<li> other matters as the practitioner deems appropriate.</li>
	</ol>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .34</b> When the engaging party is not the responsible party, and the responsible
party refuses to provide the representations in paragraph .33 in writing,
the practitioner should make inquiries of the responsible party about, and seek
oral responses to, the matters in paragraph .33. (Ref: par. .A47)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .35</b>When the engaging party is not the responsible party, the practitioner
should request written representations from the engaging party, in addition to
those requested from the responsible party, in the form of a letter addressed to
the practitioner. The representations should
<ol type="a">
	<li>acknowledge that the responsible party is responsible for the subject
matter and assertion.</li>
	<li>acknowledge the engaging party's responsibility for selecting the
criteria, when applicable.</li>
	<li>acknowledge the engaging party's responsibility for determining
that such criteria are appropriate for its purposes.</li>
	<li>state that the engaging party is not aware of any material misstatements
in the subject matter or assertion.</li>
	<li>state that the engaging party has disclosed to the practitioner all
known events subsequent to the period (or point in time) of the
subject matter being reported on that would have a material effect
on the subject matter or assertion. (Ref: par. .A45)</li>
	<li>address other matters as the practitioner deems appropriate</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .36</b> When written representations are directly related to matters that are
material to the subject matter, the practitioner should
<ol type="a">
	<li>evaluate their reasonableness and consistency with other review
evidence obtained, including other representations (oral or written)
and</li>
	<li>consider whether those making the representations can be expected
to be well informed on the particular matters</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .37</b> The date of the written representations should be as of the date of the
practitioner's report. The written representations should address the subject
matter and periods covered by the practitioner's conclusion.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requested Written Representations Not Provided or Are Unreliable</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .38</b> When the engaging party is the responsible party, and one or more
of the requested written representations are not provided, or the practitioner
concludes that there is sufficient doubt about the competence, integrity, ethical
values, or diligence of those providing the written representations, or the practitioner
concludes that the written representations are otherwise not reliable,
the practitioner should
<ol type="a">
	<li>discuss the matter with the appropriate party(ies)</li>
	<li>reevaluate the integrity of those from whom the representations
were requested or received and evaluate the effect that this may have on the reliability of representations and review evidence in
general, and</li>
	<li>if any of the matters are not resolved to the practitioner's satisfaction,
withdraw from the engagement.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .39</b> When the engaging party is not the responsible party (Ref: par. .A47–
.A49)
<ol type="a">
	<li>if one or more of the requested representations are provided in
writing by the responsible party, but the practitioner receives satisfactory
oral responses to the practitioner's inquiries performed
in accordance with paragraph .34 sufficient to enable the practitioner
to conclude that the practitioner has sufficient appropriate
review evidence to form a conclusion about the subject matter, the
practitioner's report should contain a separate paragraph that restricts
the use of the practitioner's report to the engaging party.
(Paragraphs .48–.49 contain requirements for the contents of such
a paragraph.)</li>
	<li>if one or more of the requested representations are provided neither
in writing nor orally from the responsible party in accordance
with paragraph .34, a scope limitation exists, and the practitioner
should withdraw from the engagement.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Information</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .40</b> If prior to or after the release of the practitioner's report on subject
matter or an assertion, the practitioner is willing to permit the inclusion of the
practitioner's report in a document that contains the subject matter or assertion
and other information, the practitioner should read the other information
to identify material inconsistencies, if any, with the subject matter, assertion,
or the practitioner's report. If on reading the other information, in the practitioner's
professional judgment (Ref: par. .A50–.A51)
<ul>
	<li>a material inconsistency between that other information and the
subject matter, assertion, or the practitioner's report exists, or</li>
	<li>a material misstatement of fact exists in the other information,
the subject matter, assertion, or the practitioner's report</li>
</ul>
<p>the practitioner should discuss the matter with the responsible party and take
further action as appropriate.</p>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Description of Criteria</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .41</b> The practitioner should evaluate whether the written description of
the subject matter or assertion adequately refers to or describes the criteria.
(Ref: par. .A52–.A53)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forming the Conclusion</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .42</b> The practitioner should form a conclusion about whether the practitioner
is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the subject
matter in order for it to be in accordance with (or based on) the criteria or to
the responsible party's assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. In forming
that conclusion, the practitioner should evaluate
<ol type="a">
	<li>the practitioner's conclusion regarding the sufficiency and appropriateness
of the review evidence obtained and (Ref: par. .A54)</li>
	<li>whether uncorrected misstatements are material, individually or
in the aggregate. (Ref: par. .A55)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .43</b> The practitioner should evaluate, based on the review evidence obtained,
whether the presentation of the subject matter or assertion is misleading
within the context of the engagement. (Ref: par. .A56–.A57)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preparing the Practitioner’s Report</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .44</b> The practitioner's report should be in writing. (Ref: par. .A58–.A59)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .45</b> A practitioner should report on a written assertion or should report
directly on the subject matter. If the practitioner is reporting on the assertion,
the assertion should be bound with or accompany the practitioner's report, or
the assertion should be clearly stated in the report. (Ref: par. .A60)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Content of the Practitioner’s Report</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .46</b> The practitioner's report should include the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>A title that includes the word independent. (Ref: par. .A61)</li>
	<li>An appropriate addressee as required by the circumstances of the
engagement.</li>
	<li>An identification or description of the subject matter or assertion
being reported on, including the point in time or period of time
to which the measurement or evaluation of the subject matter or
assertion relates</li>
	<li>An identification of the criteria against which the subject matter
was measured or evaluated. (Ref: par. .A62)</li>
	<li>A statement that identifies</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li> the responsible party and its responsibility for the subject
matter in accordance with (or based on) the criteria or for
its assertion and (Ref: par. .A63–.A64)</li>
		<li>the practitioner's responsibility to express a conclusion on
the subject matter or assertion, based on the practitioner's
review. (Ref: par. .A63)</li>
	</ol>
	<li>A statement that</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li> the practitioner's review was conducted in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants.</li>
		<li> those standards require that the practitioner plan and perform
the review to obtain limited assurance about whether
any material modifications should be made to</li>
<ol type="1">
	<li>the subject matter in order for it to be in accordance
with (or based on) the criteria (or equivalent
language regarding the subject matter and
criteria, such as the language used in the examples
in paragraph .A65) or</li>
	<li>the responsible party's assertion in order for it to
be fairly stated.</li>
</ol>
<li> a review is substantially less in scope than an examination,
the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the subject matter is in accordance
with (or based on) the criteria, in all material respects, or the responsible party's assertion is fairly stated, in all material

section 105, this section, and section 310, Reporting on Pro Forma
Financial Information, would be relevant.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A2</b> Review procedures generally are limited to inquiries and analytical
procedures. In circumstances in which inquiry and analytical procedures are
not expected to provide sufficient appropriate review evidence, or when the nature
of the subject matter does not lend itself to the application of analytical
procedures, the practitioner may perform other procedures that he or she believes
can provide the practitioner with a level of assurance equivalent to that
which inquiries and analytical procedures would have provided. If the practitioner
cannot design other procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate review
evidence, a review engagement may not be appropriate.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agreeing on the Terms of the Engagement
(Ref: par. .08 and .09b</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A3</b> It is in the interests of both the engaging party and the practitioner to
document the agreed-upon terms of the engagement before the commencement
of the engagement to help avoid misunderstandings. The form and content of
the engagement letter or other suitable form of written agreement will vary
with the engagement circumstances.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A4</b> A practitioner may further describe the responsibilities of the practitioner
by adding the following items to the engagement letter or other suitable
form of written agreement:
<ol type="a">
	<li>A statement that a review is designed to obtain limited assurance
about whether any material modifications should be made to the
subject matter in order for it to be in accordance with (or based
on) the criteria</li>
	<li>A statement that the objective of a review is the expression of
a conclusion in a written practitioner's report about whether the practitioner is aware of any material modifications that should be

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requesting a Written Assertion (Ref: par. .11)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A5</b> The language of the responsible party's written assertion in paragraph
.11 may need to be tailored to reflect the nature of the subject matter and criteria
for the engagement. Examples of language that meet the requirements in
paragraph .11 include the following:
<ul>
	<li>The subject matter is presented in accordance with (or based on)
the criteria.</li>
	<li>The subject matter achieved the objectives, for example, when the
objectives are the criteria.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A6</b> Situations may arise in which the current responsible party was not
present during some or all of the period covered by the practitioner's report.
Such persons may contend that they are not in a position to provide a written
assertion that covers the entire period because they were not in place during
some or all of the period. This fact, however, does not diminish such persons'
responsibilities for the subject matter as a whole. Accordingly, the requirement
for the practitioner to request a written assertion from the responsible party
that covers the entire relevant period(s) still applies.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A7</b> Paragraph .33a requires the practitioner to request a written representation
from the responsible party that is the same as the responsible party's
assertion. If the responsible party provides the practitioner with the written
representation in paragraph .33a, the practitioner need not request a separate
written assertion, unless a separate written assertion is called for by the engagement
circumstances. (Ref: par. .11)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A8</b> A practitioner may also be engaged to assist the responsible party in
measuring or evaluating the subject matter against the criteria in connection
with the responsible party providing a written assertion. Regardless of the procedures
performed by the practitioner, the responsible party is required to accept
responsibility for its assertion and the subject matter and may not base
its assertion solely on the practitioner's procedures.2</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Planning and Performing the Engagement (Ref: par. .12–.13)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A9</b>Planning involves the engagement partner and other key members of
the engagement team and may involve the practitioner's specialists. Adequate
planning helps the practitioner devote appropriate attention to important areas
of the engagement, identify potential problems on a timely basis, and properly
organize and manage the engagement in order for it to be performed in an
effective and efficient manner. Adequate planning also assists the practitioner
in properly assigning work to engagement team members, and facilitates the
direction, supervision, and the review of their work. Further, it assists, when
applicable, the coordination of work performed by other practitioners and practitioner's
specialists. The nature and extent of planning activities will vary with the engagement circumstances, for example, the complexity of the assessment
or evaluation of the subject matter and the practitioner's previous experience
with it. Examples of relevant matters that may be considered include the following:
<ul>
	<li>The characteristics of the engagement that define its scope, including
the terms of the engagement, the characteristics of the
underlying subject matter, and the criteria</li>
	<li>The expected timing and nature of the communications required</li>
	<li>The results of preliminary engagement activities, such as client
acceptance, and, when applicable, whether knowledge gained on
other engagements performed by the engagement partner for the
appropriate party(ies) is relevant</li>
	<li>The engagement process, including possible sources of review evidence,
and choices among alternative measurement or evaluation
methods</li>
	<li>The practitioner's understanding of the appropriate party(ies) and
its (their) environment, including the risks that the subject matter
may be materially misstated</li>
	<li>Identification of intended users and their information needs and
consideration of materiality and the components of attestation
risk</li>
	<li>The risk of fraud relevant to the engagement</li>
	<li>The effect on the engagement of using the internal audit function</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A10</b>The practitioner may decide to discuss elements of planning with the
appropriate party(ies) to facilitate the conduct and management of the engagement
(for example, to coordinate some of the planned procedures with the work
of the responsible party's personnel). Although these discussions often occur,
the elements of planning remain the practitioner's responsibility. When discussing
planning matters, care is needed to avoid compromising the effectiveness
of the engagement. For example, discussing the nature and timing of detailed
procedures with the responsible party may compromise the effectiveness
of the engagement by making the procedures too predictable</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A11</b>Planning is not a discrete phase but, rather, a cumulative and iterative
process throughout the engagement. As a result of unexpected events,
changes in conditions, or review evidence obtained, the practitioner may need
to revise the nature, timing, and extent of planned procedures.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A12</b>In smaller or less complex engagements, the entire engagement may
be conducted by a very small engagement team, possibly involving the engagement
partner (who may be a sole practitioner) working without any other engagement
team members. With a smaller team, coordination of, and communication
among, team members is easier. In such cases, planning the engagement
need not be a complex or time-consuming exercise; it varies according to the size
of the entity, the complexity of the engagement, and the size of the engagement
team.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A13</b>Obtaining an understanding of the subject matter and other engagement
circumstances provides the practitioner with a frame of reference for exercising
professional judgment throughout the engagement, for example, when
<ul>
	<li>considering the characteristics of the subject matter;</li>
	<li>assessing the suitability of the criteria;</li>
	<li>considering the factors that, in the practitioner's professional
judgment, are significant in directing the engagement team's efforts,
including situations in which special consideration may be
necessary (for example, when there is a need for specialized skills
or the work of a specialist);</li>
	<li>establishing and evaluating the continued appropriateness of
quantitative materiality levels (when appropriate) and considering
qualitative materiality factors;</li>
	<li>developing expectations when performing analytical procedures;</li>
	<li>designing and performing procedures; and</li>
	<li>evaluating review evidence, including the reasonableness of the
written representations received by the practitioner.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some review engagements, the practitioner may obtain an understanding of
internal control over the measurement, evaluation, or disclosure of the subject
matter</p>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Materiality in Planning and Performing the Engagement
(Ref: par. .14)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A14</b>Materiality is considered in the context of qualitative factors and,
when applicable, quantitative factors. The relative importance of qualitative
factors and quantitative factors when considering materiality in a particular
engagement is a matter for the practitioner's professional judgment.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A15</b>Professional judgments about materiality are made in light of surrounding
circumstances, but they are not affected by the level of assurance,
that is, for the same intended users, materiality for a review engagement is the
same as it is for an examination engagement because materiality is based on
the information needs of intended users and not the level of assurance.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A16</b>In general, misstatements, including omissions, are considered to be
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence relevant decisions of intended users that are made based on the
subject matter. The practitioner's consideration of materiality is a matter of
professional judgment and is affected by the practitioner's perception of the
common information needs of intended users as a group. In this context, it is
reasonable for the practitioner to assume that intended users
<ol type="a">
	<li>have a reasonable knowledge of the subject matter and a willingness
to study the subject matter with reasonable diligence.</li>
	<li>understand that the subject matter is measured or evaluated and
reviewed to appropriate levels of materiality and have an understanding
of any materiality concepts included in the criteria.</li>
	<li>understand any inherent uncertainties involved in measuring or
evaluating the subject matter</li>
	<li>make reasonable decisions on the basis of the subject matter
taken as a whole.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless the engagement has been designed to meet the particular information
needs of specific users, the possible effect of misstatements on specific users,
whose information needs may vary widely, is not ordinarily considered.</p>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A17 </b>Qualitative factors may include the following:
<ul>
	<li>The interaction between, and relative importance of, various aspects
of the subject matter, such as numerous performance indicators</li>
	<li>The wording chosen with respect to subject matter that is expressed
in narrative form, for example, the wording chosen does
not omit or distort the information</li>
	<li>The characteristics of the presentation adopted for the subject
matter when the criteria allow for variations in that presentation</li>
	<li>The nature of a misstatement</li>
	<li>Whether a misstatement affects compliance with laws or regulations</li>
	<li>In the case of periodic reporting on a subject matter, the effect of
an adjustment that affects past or current information about the
subject matter or is likely to affect future information about the
subject matter</li>
	<li>Whether a misstatement is the result of an intentional act or is
unintentional</li>
	<li>Whether a misstatement is significant with regard to the practitioner's
understanding of known previous communications to
users, for example, in relation to the expected outcome of the measurement
or evaluation of the subject matter</li>
	<li>Whether a misstatement relates to the relationship between the
responsible party and, if different, the engaging party or its relationship
with other parties</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A18 </b>Quantitative factors relate to the magnitude of misstatements relative
to reported amounts for those aspects of the subject matter, if any, that
are
<ul>
	<li>expressed numerically or</li>
	<li>otherwise related to numerical values.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A19</b> The criteria may discuss the concept of materiality in the context of
the preparation and presentation of the subject matter and thereby provide a
frame of reference for the practitioner in considering materiality for the engagement.
Although criteria may discuss materiality in different terms, the concept
of materiality generally includes the matters discussed in paragraphs .A14–
.A18. If the criteria do not include a discussion of the concept of materiality,
these paragraphs provide the practitioner with a frame of reference.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Procedures to Be Performed (Ref: par. .16–.18)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A20</b> Review evidence obtained through the performance of analytical procedures
and inquiry will ordinarily provide the practitioner with a reasonable
basis for obtaining limited assurance. However, the practitioner may determine
it is appropriate to perform additional procedures if the practitioner determines
such procedures to be necessary in order to meet the objectives of this section.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A21</b> The degree to which procedures beyond analytical procedures and
inquiry may be performed may be influenced by factors specific to the engagement.
The practitioner may substitute other procedures that provide equivalent
levels of review evidence</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A22</b> Information may come to the practitioner's attention that differs significantly
from that on which the determination of planned procedures was based. As the practitioner performs planned procedures, the review evidence
obtained may cause the practitioner to perform additional procedures. Such
procedures may include asking the responsible party to examine the matter
identified by the practitioner and to make adjustments to the subject matter, if
appropriate.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A23</b> In some cases, a subject-matter AT-C section may include requirements
that affect the nature, timing, and extent of procedures. For example,
a subject-matter AT-C section may describe the nature or extent of particular
procedures to be performed in a particular type of engagement. Even in such
cases, determining the exact nature, timing, and extent of procedures is a matter
of professional judgment and will vary from one engagement to the next.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A24</b> Review procedures generally are limited to inquiries and analytical
procedures. In circumstances in which inquiry and analytical procedures are
not expected to provide sufficient appropriate review evidence, or when the nature
of the subject matter does not lend itself to the application of analytical
procedures, the practitioner may perform other procedures that he or she believes
can provide the practitioner with a level of assurance equivalent to that
which inquiries and analytical procedures would have provided. If the practitioner
cannot design other procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate review
evidence, a review engagement may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A25</b> The results of the practitioner's analytical procedures and inquiries
may modify the practitioner's risk awareness.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A26</b> The practitioner may become aware of a matter(s) that causes the
practitioner to believe that the subject matter may be materially misstated
when, for example, performing analytical procedures if the practitioner identifies
a fluctuation or relationship that is inconsistent with other relevant information
or that differs significantly from expected amounts or ratios. In such
cases, the practitioner's investigation of such differences may include inquiring
of the responsible party or performing other procedures as appropriate in the
circumstances.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analytical Procedures (Ref: par. .19–.20)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A27</b> An understanding of the purposes of analytical procedures and the
limitations of those procedures is important. Accordingly, the identification of
the relationships and types of data used, as well as conclusions reached when
recorded amounts are compared to expectations, requires professional judgment
by the practitioner.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A28</b> Analytical procedures involve comparisons of expectations developed
by the practitioner to recorded amounts or ratios developed from recorded
amounts. The practitioner develops such expectations by identifying and using
plausible relationships that are reasonably expected to exist based on the
practitioner's understanding of the subject matter; the practices used by the
responsible party to measure, recognize, and record the subject matter; and, if
applicable, the industry in which the entity operates.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A29</b> Analytical procedures in a review engagement are not designed to
identify misstatements with the level of precision expected in an examination
engagement. Further, when significant fluctuations, relationships, or differences
are identified, appropriate review evidence in a review engagement
may often be obtained by making inquiries of the responsible party and considering
responses received in the light of known engagement circumstances
without obtaining additional evidence required in the case of an examination
engagement.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inquiries and Other Review Procedures (Ref: par. .21)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A30</b> The practitioner is not ordinarily required to corroborate the responsible
party's responses with other review evidence.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fraud, Laws, and Regulations (Ref: par. .24)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A31</b> In responding to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the engagement,
it may be appropriate, unless prohibited by law, regulation, or ethics
standards, for the practitioner to, for example
<ul>
	<li>discuss the matter with the appropriate party(ies).</li>
	<li>request that the responsible party consult with an appropriately
qualified third party, such as the entity's legal counsel or a regulator</li>
	<li>consider the implications of the matter in relation to other aspects
of the engagement, including the practitioner's planning and the
reliability of written representations from the responsible party.</li>
	<li>obtain legal advice about the consequences of different courses of
action.</li>
	<li>communicate with third parties (for example, a regulator).</li>
	<li>withdraw from the engagement.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A32</b> The actions noted in paragraph .A31 also may be appropriate in responding
to noncompliance or suspected noncompliance with laws or regulations
identified during the engagement. It may also be appropriate to describe
the matter in a separate paragraph of the practitioner's report, unless the practitioner
<ol type="a">
	<li>is precluded by the responsible party from obtaining sufficient
appropriate review evidence to evaluate whether noncompliance
that may be material to the subject matter has, or is likely to have,
occurred, in which case, paragraph .58 applies or</li>
	<li>concludes that the noncompliance results in a material misstatement
of the subject matter, in which case, paragraphs .51–.57
apply</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluating the Results of Review Procedures (Ref: par. .28–.29</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A33</b> Uncorrected misstatements are accumulated during the engagement
for the purpose of evaluating whether, individually or in aggregate, they are
material when forming the practitioner's conclusion. (See paragraph .42b.)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A34</b> "Clearly trivial" is not another expression for "not material." Matters
that are clearly trivial will be of a wholly different (smaller) order of magnitude
than materiality and will be matters that are clearly inconsequential, whether
taken individually or in the aggregate and whether judged by any criteria of
size, nature, or circumstances. When there is any uncertainty about whether
one or more items are clearly trivial, the matter is considered not to be clearly
trivial.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A35</b> Sufficient appropriate review evidence is necessary to support the
practitioner's conclusion and report.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A36</b> The sufficiency and appropriateness of review evidence are interrelated.
Sufficiency of review evidence is the measure of the quantity of review evidence. The quantity of the review evidence needed is affected by the risks of
material misstatement and also by the quality of such review evidence.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A37</b> Whether sufficient appropriate review evidence has been obtained on
which to base the practitioner's conclusion is a matter of professional judgment.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering Subsequent Events and Subsequently Discovered
Facts (Ref: par. .31–.32)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A38</b> For certain subject-matter AT-C sections, specific subsequent events
requirements and related application guidance have been developed for engagement
performance and reporting.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A39</b> Procedures that a practitioner may perform to identify subsequent
events include inquiring about and considering information
<ul>
	<li>contained in relevant reports issued during the subsequent period
by internal auditors, other practitioners, or regulatory agencies</li>
	<li>obtained through other professional engagements for that entity</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A40</b> If the responsible party refuses to disclose a subsequent event for
which disclosure is necessary to prevent users of the practitioner's report from
being misled, appropriate actions the practitioner may take include
<ul>
	<li>disclosing the event in the report and modifying the practitioner's
conclusion.</li>
	<li>withdrawing from the engagement.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A41</b> Subsequent to the date of the practitioner's report, the practitioner
may become aware of facts that, had they been known to the practitioner at
that date, may have caused the practitioner to revise the report. In such circumstances,
the practitioner undertakes to determine whether the facts existed
at the date of the report and, if so, whether persons are currently using or
likely to use the report and related subject matter or assertion who would attach
importance to these facts. This may include discussing the matter with the
appropriate party(ies) and requesting the appropriate party(ies)'s cooperation
in whatever investigation or further action that may be necessary. The specific
actions to be taken in a particular case by the appropriate party(ies) and the
practitioner may vary with the circumstances. Consideration may be given to,
among other things, the time elapsed since the date of the report and whether
issuance of a subsequent report is imminent. The practitioner may need to perform
additional procedures deemed necessary to determine whether the subject
matter or assertion needs revision and whether the previously issued report
continues to be appropriate.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A42</b> Depending on the circumstances, the practitioner may determine
that notification of the situation by the appropriate party(ies) to persons who
would attach importance to these facts and who are currently using, or are
likely to use, the practitioner's report who would attach importance to the facts
is necessary. This may be the case, for example, when
<ol type="a">
	<li> the report is not to be relied upon because the subject matter or
assertion needs revision or the practitioner is unable to determine
whether revision is necessary, and</li>
	<li> issuance of a subsequent report is not imminent.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the appropriate party(ies) failed to take the necessary steps to prevent reliance
on the report, the practitioner's course of action depends upon the practitioner's
legal and ethical rights and obligations. Consequently, the practitioner
may consider it appropriate to seek legal advice prior to making any disclosure of the situation. Disclosure of the situation directly by the practitioner may include
a description of the nature of the matter and of its effect on the subject
matter or assertion and the report, avoiding comments concerning the conduct
or motives of any person.</p>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written Representations (Ref: par. .33–.34, .35e, and .39a)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A43</b> Written confirmation of oral representations reduces the possibility
of misunderstandings between the practitioner and the responsible party. The
person(s) from whom the practitioner requests written representations is ordinarily
a member of senior management or those charged with governance
depending on, for example, the management and governance structure of the
responsible party(ies), which may vary by entity, reflecting influences such as
size and ownership characteristics.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A44</b> Representations by the responsible party cannot replace other review
evidence the practitioner could reasonably expect to be available. Although
written representations provide review evidence, they do not provide sufficient
appropriate review evidence on their own about any of the matters with which
they deal. Furthermore, the fact that the practitioner has received reliable written
representations does not affect the nature or extent of other review evidence
that the practitioner obtains.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A45</b> A discussion of what is considered a material effect on the subject
matter or assertion may be included explicitly in the representation letter in
qualitative or quantitative terms.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A46</b> A summary of uncorrected misstatements ordinarily is included in
or attached to the written representation.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A47</b> Certain subject-matter AT-C sections do not permit the practitioner
to perform the alternative procedures described in paragraphs .34 and .39a
(making inquiries of the responsible party and restricting the use of the practitioner's
report)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requested Written Representations Not Provided or Not
Reliable (Ref: par. .39)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A48</b> Even when the responsible party provides oral responses to the matters
in paragraph .33, the practitioner may find it appropriate to consider
whether there are significant concerns about the competence, integrity, ethical
values, or diligence of those providing the oral responses or whether the
oral responses are otherwise not reliable and the potential effect, if any, on the
practitioner's report.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A49</b> Paragraph .11 provides an exception to the requirement for a written
assertion when the engaging party is not the responsible party. Nonetheless,
because the assertion is the representation called for by paragraph .33a,
application of paragraph .39a requires the practitioner to obtain an oral assertion,
when a written assertion is not obtained. Paragraph .39b applies when
the responsible party provides neither a written nor an oral assertion.
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Information (Ref: par. .40)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A50</b> Further actions that may be appropriate if the practitioner identifies
a material inconsistency or becomes aware of a material misstatement of fact
include, for example, the following:
<ul>
	<li>Requesting the appropriate party(ies) to consult with a qualified
third party, such as the appropriate party(ies)'s legal counsel</li>
	<li>Obtaining legal advice about the consequences of different courses
of action</li>
	<li>If required or permissible, communicating with third parties (for
example, a regulator)</li>
	<li>Describing the material inconsistency in the practitioner's report</li>
	<li>Withdrawing from the engagement, when withdrawal is possible
under applicable law or regulation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A51</b> Other information does not include information contained on the appropriate
party(ies)'s website. Websites are a means of distributing information
and are not, themselves, documents for the purposes of paragraph .40.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Description of Criteria (Ref: par. .41)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A52</b> The description of the criteria on which the subject matter or assertion
is based is particularly important when there are significant differences
between various criteria regarding how particular matters may be treated in
the subject matter.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A53</b> A description of the criteria that states that the subject matter is
prepared in accordance with (or based on) particular criteria is appropriate only
if the subject matter complies with all relevant requirements of those criteria
that are effective.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forming the Conclusion (Ref: par. .42–.43)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A54</b> The practitioner's professional judgment regarding what constitutes
sufficient appropriate review evidence is influenced by such factors as the following:
<ul>
	<li>The significance of a potential misstatement and the likelihood
that it will have a material effect, individually or aggregated with
other potential misstatements, on the subject matter or assertion</li>
	<li>The effectiveness of the responsible party's responses to address
the known risks</li>
	<li>The experience gained during previous examination or review engagements
with respect to similar potential misstatements</li>
	<li>The results of procedures performed, including whether such procedures
identified specific misstatements</li>
	<li>The source and reliability of the available information</li>
	<li>The persuasiveness of the review evidence</li>
	<li>The practitioner's understanding of the responsible party and its
environment</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A55</b> A review engagement is a cumulative and iterative process. As the
practitioner performs planned procedures, the review evidence obtained may
cause the practitioner to change the nature, timing, or extent of other planned
procedures. Information that differs significantly from the information on
which the planned procedures were based may come to the practitioner's attention,
for example
<ul>
	<li>the extent of the misstatements that the practitioner detects
is greater than expected. (This may alter the practitioner's professional judgment about the reliability of particular sources
of information.)</li>
	<li>the practitioner may become aware of discrepancies in relevant
information or conflicting or missing review evidence.</li>
	<li>procedures performed toward the end of the engagement may indicate
a previously unrecognized risk of material misstatement.
In such circumstances, the practitioner may need to reevaluate
the planned procedures.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A56</b> In making the evaluation required by paragraph .43, the practitioner
may consider whether additional disclosures are necessary to describe the subject
matter, assertion, or criteria. Additional disclosures may, for example, include
<ul>
	<li>the measurement or evaluation methods used when the criteria
allow for choice among methods;</li>
	<li>significant interpretations</li>
	<li>subsequent events, depending on their nature and significance;
and</li>
	<li>whether there have been any changes in the measurement or evaluation
methods used.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A57</b> Paragraph .43 does not require the practitioner to determine whether
the presentation discloses all matters related to the subject matter, assertion,
or criteria or all matters users may consider in making decisions based on the
presentation.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preparing the Practitioner’s Report (Ref: par. .44–.45)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A58</b> Oral and other forms of expressing a conclusion can be misunderstood
without the support of a written practitioner's report. For this reason,
the practitioner may not report orally or by use of symbols (such as a web seal)
under the attestation standards without also providing a written report that
is readily available whenever the oral report is provided or the symbol is used.
For example, a symbol could be hyperlinked to a written report on the Internet.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A59</b> This section does not require a standardized format for reporting on
all review engagements. Instead, it identifies the basic elements that the practitioner's
report is to include. The report is tailored to the specific engagement
circumstances. The practitioner may use headings, separate paragraphs, paragraph
numbers, typographical devices (for example, the bolding of text), and
other mechanisms to enhance the clarity and readability of the report</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A60</b> All of the following reporting options are available to a practitioner,
except when the circumstances described in paragraph .54 exist.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Content of the Practitioner’s Report
</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Title (Ref: par. .46a</i>
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A61</b> A title indicating that the practitioner's report is the report of an independent
practitioner (for example, "Independent Practitioner's Report," "Report
of Independent Certified Public Accountant," or "Independent Accountant's
Review Report") affirms that the practitioner has met all the relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence and, therefore, distinguishes the
independent practitioner's report from reports issued by others.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Criteria (Ref: par. .46d)</i>
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A62</b> The practitioner's report may include the criteria or refer to them if
they are included in the subject matter presentation, in the assertion, or are
otherwise readily available.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Relative Responsibilities (Ref: par. .46e)</i>
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A63</b> Identifying relative responsibilities informs the intended users that
the responsible party is responsible for the subject matter, and the practitioner's
role is to independently express a conclusion about it</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A64</b> The practitioner may wish to expand the discussion of the responsible
party's responsibility, for example, to indicate that the responsible party is
responsible for the preparation and presentation of the subject matter in accordance
with (or based on) the criteria, including the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatement
of the subject matter, due to fraud or error.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Statement About the Subject Matter and Criteria (Ref: par. 46f[ii][1])</i>
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A65</b> The language in paragraph .46f(ii)(1) may need to be tailored to reflect
the nature of the subject matter and criteria for the engagement. Examples
of language that meet the requirements in paragraph .46f(ii)(1) include,
"to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should
be made to the subject matter in order for it to
<ul>
	<li>be presented in accordance with (or based on) the criteria."</li>
	<li>meet the objectives," for example, when the objectives are the criteria.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Inherent Limitations (Ref: par. .46g)</i>
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A66</b> In some cases, identification of specific inherent limitations may be
required by an AT-C section. To communicate specific inherent limitations, the
illustrative practitioner's report on a review of pro forma financial information
under section 310, for example, indicates that the objective of pro forma
financial information is to show what the significant effects on the historical
financial information might have been had the transaction (or event) occurred
at an earlier date and that the pro forma condensed financial statements are
not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or related effects on financial
position that would have been attained had the specified transaction
(or event) actually occurred earlier.3 When not explicitly required by an AT-C
section, identification in the report of inherent limitations is based on the practitioner's
judgment.
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Conclusion (Ref: par. .46h)</i>
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A67</b> The practitioner's conclusion can be worded either in terms of the
subject matter and the criteria (for example, "Based on our review, we are not
aware of any material modifications that should be made to the XYZ schedule
in order for it to be in accordance with [or based on] the ABC criteria.") or in
terms of an assertion made by the responsible party (for example, "Based on our
review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to
management of XYZ Company's assertion in order for it to be fairly stated.").
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A68</b> A single practitioner's report may cover more than one aspect of a
subject matter or an assertion about the subject matter. When that is the case,
the report may contain separate opinions or conclusions on each aspect of the
subject matter or assertion (for example, examination level related to some aspects
or assertions and review level related to others, or an unmodified conclusion
on some aspects or assertions and a modified conclusion on others).
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A69</b> A practitioner may report on subject matter or an assertion at multiple
dates or covering multiple periods during which criteria have changed
(for example, a practitioner's report on comparative information). Criteria are
clearly described when they identify the criteria for each period and how the
criteria have changed from one period to the next. If the criteria for the current
date or period have changed from the criteria for a preceding date or period,
changes in the criteria may be significant to users of the report. If so, the criteria
and the fact that they have changed may be disclosed in the presentation of
the subject matter, in the written assertion, or in the report, even if the subject
matter for the preceding date or period is not presented. 
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Location (Ref: par. .46j)</i>
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A70</b> In the United States, the location of the issuing office is the city and state. In another country, it may be the city and country
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Date (Ref: par. .46k)</i>
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A71</b> Including the date of the practitioner's report informs the intended
users that the practitioner has considered the effect on the subject matter and
on the report of events that occurred up to that date.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A72</b> Because the practitioner expresses a conclusion on the subject matter
or assertion and the subject matter or assertion is the responsibility of the
responsible party, the practitioner is not in a position to conclude that sufficient
appropriate review evidence has been obtained until evidence is obtained that
all of the elements that the subject matter or assertion comprises, including
any related notes, when applicable, have been prepared, and the responsible
party has accepted responsibility for them.
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Restricted Use Paragraph (Ref: par. .47 and .48b–c</i>
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A73</b> A practitioner's report for which the conditions in paragraph .47 do
not apply need not include an alert that restricts its use. However, nothing in
the attestation standards precludes a practitioner from including such an alert
in any practitioner's report or other practitioner's written communication.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A74</b> A practitioner's report that is required by paragraph .47 to include an
alert that restricts the use of the report may be included in a document that also
contains a practitioner's report that is for general use. In such circumstances,
the use of the general use report is not affected.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A75</b> A practitioner may also issue a single combined practitioner's report
that includes (a) a practitioner's report that is required by paragraph .47 to include an alert that restricts its use, and (b) a report that is for general use. If
these two types of reports are clearly differentiated within the combined report,
such as through the use of appropriate headers, the alert that restricts the use
of the report may be limited to the report required by paragraph .47 to include
such an alert. In such circumstances, the use of the general use report is not
affected.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A76</b> The representations required by paragraph .33 include an assertion.
If the engaging party is not the responsible party and the responsible party
provides an oral assertion, rather than a written assertion, paragraph .47c calls
for an alert that restricts the use of the practitioner's report to the engaging
party.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A77</b> The practitioner may identify the specified parties by naming them,
referring to a list of those parties, or identifying the class of parties, for example,
"all customers of XYZ Company during some or all of the period January 1,
20XX to December 31, 20XX." The method of identifying the specified parties
is determined by the practitioner.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A78</b> In some cases, the criteria used to measure or evaluate the subject
matter may be designed for a specific purpose. For example, a regulator may
require certain entities to use particular criteria designed for regulatory purposes.
To avoid misunderstandings, the practitioner alerts users of the practitioner's
report to this fact and, therefore, that the report is intended solely for
the information and use of the specified parties
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A79</b> The alert that restricts the use of the practitioner's report is designed
to avoid misunderstandings related to the use of the report, particularly if the
report is taken out of the context in which the report is intended to be used.
A practitioner may consider informing the responsible party and, if different,
the engaging party or other specified parties that the report is not intended for
distribution to parties other than those specified in the report. The practitioner
may, in connection with establishing the terms of the engagement, reach an understanding
with the responsible party or, if different, the engaging party, that
the intended use of the report will be restricted and may obtain the responsible
party's agreement that the responsible party and specified parties will not distribute
such report to parties other than those identified therein. A practitioner
is not responsible for controlling, and cannot control, distribution of the report
after its release.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A80</b> In some cases, a restricted-use practitioner's report filed with regulatory
agencies is required by law or regulation to be made available to the public
as a matter of public record. Also, a regulatory agency, as part of its oversight
responsibility for an entity, may require access to the restricted-use report in
which it is not named as a specified party.

limited compared with those performed in an examination engagement. Limitations
known to exist prior to accepting a review engagement are a relevant

are present, in particular, whether the practitioner expects to be able
to obtain the evidence needed to arrive at the practitioner's conclusion. (See section

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A85</b> The inability to obtain written representations from the responsible
party ordinarily would result in a scope limitation. However, when the engaging
party is not the responsible party, paragraph .34 enables the practitioner
to make inquiries of the responsible party, and if the responsible party's oral
responses enable the practitioner to conclude that the practitioner has sufficient
appropriate review evidence to form a conclusion about the subject matter,
paragraph .39a indicates that this would not cause a scope limitation. Further,
paragraph .39a requires that the practitioner's report, in these circumstances,
contain an alert paragraph that restricts the use of the report to the engaging
party.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A86</b> An inability to perform a specific procedure does not constitute a
scope limitation if the practitioner is able to obtain sufficient appropriate review
evidence by performing alternative procedures.

.60:

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A88</b> The practitioner's report discussed in paragraph .60 is appropriate only when the engagement is to report on the subject matter; it is not appropriate for a report on an assertion. When reporting on an assertion, the practitioner is required to obtain a written assertion from the responsible party.

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communication Responsibilities (Ref: par. .61)
</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A89</b> Other matters that may be appropriate to communicate to the responsible

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A90</b> Documentation includes a record of the practitioner's reasoning on
all significant findings or issues that require the exercise of professional judgment
and related conclusions. The existence of difficult questions of principle or
professional judgment calls for the documentation to include the relevant facts
that were known by the practitioner at the time the conclusion was reached.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A91</b> It is neither necessary nor practical to document every matter considered,
or professional judgment made, during an engagement. Further, it is
unnecessary for the practitioner to document separately (as in a checklist, for
example) compliance with matters for which compliance is demonstrated by
documents included in the engagement file. Similarly, the practitioner need not
include in the engagement file superseded drafts of working papers, notes that
reflect incomplete or preliminary thinking, previous copies of documents corrected
for typographical or other errors, and duplicates of documents
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A92</b> In applying professional judgment to assess the extent of documentation
to be prepared and retained, the practitioner may consider what is necessary
to provide an experienced practitioner, having no previous connection
with the engagement, with an understanding of the work performed and the
basis of the principal decisions made.

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A93</b> Documentation ordinarily includes a record of
<ul>
	<li>issues identified with respect to compliance with relevant ethical
requirements and how they were resolved.</li>
	<li>conclusions on compliance with independence requirements that
apply to the engagement and any relevant discussions with the
firm that support these conclusions.</li>
	<li>conclusions reached regarding the acceptance and continuance of
client relationships and attestation engagements.</li>
	<li>the nature and scope of, and conclusions resulting from, consultations
undertaken during the course of the engagement.</li>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A90</b> The illustrative practitioner's review reports in this exhibit meet the applicable
reporting requirements in paragraphs .44–.60. A practitioner may use alternative
language in drafting a review report, provided that the language meets the
applicable requirements in paragraphs .44–.60. The criteria for evaluating the
subject matter in examples 1 and 3 have been determined by the practitioner to
be suitable and available to all users of the report; therefore, these reports may
be for general use. The criteria for evaluating the subject matter in example 2
are suitable but available only to specified parties; therefore, use of this report
is restricted to the specified parties who either participated in the establishment
of the criteria or can be presumed to have an adequate understanding of
the criteria. (See paragraph .48 for the information to be included in a separate
paragraph of the report that contains an alert that restricts the use of the report
and paragraph .49 for the content of that paragraph when the engagement
is also performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards.)
