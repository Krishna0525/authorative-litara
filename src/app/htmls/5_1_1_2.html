<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-1</b>  This section provides guidance on measuring amounts that arise form repurchases on an entity's own outstanding common stock.  The measurement issues addressed include both of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Determining the allocation of amounts paid to the repurchased shares and other elements of the repurchase transaction
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Further allocation of amounts allocated to repurchased shares to various components of stockholder equity upon formal or constructive retirement.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Allocating Repurchase Price to Other Elements of the Repurchase Transaction</b>  
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-2</b>  An allocation of repurchase price to other elements of the repurchase transaction may be required if an entity purchases treasury shares at a stated price significantly in excess of the current market price of the shares.  An agreement to repurchase shares from a shareholder may also involve the receipt or payment of consideration in exchange for stated or unstated rights or privileges that shall be identified to properly allocate the repurchase price.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-3</b>  For example, the selling shareholder may agree to abandon certain acquisition plans, forgo other planned transactions, settle litigation, settle employment contracts, or restrict voluntarily the ability to purchase shares of the entity or its affiliates within a stated time period.  If the purchase of treasury shares includes the receipt of stated or unstated rights, privileges,or agreements in addition to the capital stock, only the amount representing the fair value of the treasury shares at the date the major terms of the agreement to purchase the shares are reached shall be accounted for as cost of the  shares acquired.  The price paid in excess of the amount accounted for as the cost of treasury shares shall be attributed to the other elements of the transaction and accounted for according to their substance.  If the fair value of those other elements of the transaction is more clearly evident, for example, because an entity's shares are not publicly traded, that amount shall be assigned to those elements and the difference recorded as the cost of treasury shares.  If no stated or unstated consideration in addition to the capital stock can be identified, the entire purchase price shall be accounted for as the cost of treasury shares.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-4</b>  Transactions do arise, however, in which a reacquisition of an entity's stock may take place at prices different from routine transactions in the open market.  For example, to obtain the desired number of shares in a tender offer to all or most shareholders, the offer may need to be at a price in excess of the current market price.  In addition, a block of shares representing a controlling interest will generally trade at a price in excess of market, and a large block of shares may trade at a price above or below the current market price depending on whether the buyer or seller initiates the transaction.  An entity's reacquisition of its shares in those circumstances is solely a treasury stock transaction properly accounted for at the purchase price of the treasury shares.  Therefore, in the absence of the receipt of stated or unstated consideration in addition to the capital stock, the entire purchase price shall be accounted for as the cost of treasury shares.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Allocating the Cost of Treasury Shares to Components of Shareholder Equity Upon Formal or Constructive Retirement </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-5 </b>An entity that repurchases its own outstanding common stock may be required under paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">505-30-30-3</u> to allocate a portion of the repurchase price to other elements of the transaction. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-6   </b>Once the cost of the treasury shares is determined under the requirements of this Section, and if a corporation's stock is acquired for purposes other than retirement (formal or constructive), or if ultimate disposition has not yet been decided, paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">505-30-45-1</u> permits the cost of acquired stock to either be shown separately as a deduction from the total of capital stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, or be accorded the following accounting treatment appropriate for retired stock
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-7   </b>The difference between the cost of the treasury shares and the stated value of a corporation's common stock repurchased and retired, or repurchased for constructive retirement, shall be reflected in capital. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-8   </b>When a corporation's stock is retired, or repurchased for constructive retirement (with or without an intention to retire the stock formally in accordance with applicable laws), an excess of repurchase price over par or stated value may be allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. Alternatively, the excess may be charged entirely to retained earnings in recognition of the fact that a corporation can always capitalize or allocate retained earnings for such purposes. If a portion of the excess is allocated to additional paid-in capital, it shall be limited to the sum of both of the following: 
</p><p>a.  All additional paid-in capital arising from previous retirements and net gains on sales of treasury stock of the same issue 
</p><p>b.  The pro rata portion of additional paid-in capital, voluntary transfers of retained earnings, capitalization of stock dividends, and so forth, on the same issue. For this purpose, any remaining additional paid-in capital applicable to issues fully retired (formal or constructive) is deemed to be applicable pro rata to shares of common stock. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-9   </b>When a corporation's stock is retired, or repurchased for constructive retirement (with or without an intention to retire the stock formally in accordance with applicable laws), <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">an excess of par or stated value over the cost of treasury shares</i> shall be credited to additional paid-in capital. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-10   </b>Gains on sales of treasury stock not previously accounted for as constructively retired shall be credited to additional paid-in capital; losses may be charged to additional paid-in capital to the extent that previous net gains from sales or retirements of the same class of stock are included therein, otherwise to retained earnings.
