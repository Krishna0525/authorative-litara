<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .03 </b> A practitioner's report issued in accordance with the provisions of this
section does not provide a legal determination of an entity's compliance with
specified requirements. However, such a report may be useful to legal counsel
or others in making such determinations.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .04 </b> In addition to complying with this section, a practitioner is required to
comply with section 105,
Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements
,and either section 205,
Examination Engagements
, for examinations of compliance,
or section 215,
Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements
, for agreed-upon proce-
dures engagements that address compliance. In some cases, this section repeats
or refers to requirements found in sections 105, 205, and 215 when describing
those requirements in the context of engagements that address compliance. Al-
though not all the requirements in sections 105, 205, and 215 are repeated or
referred to in this section, the practitioner is responsible for complying with all
the requirements in sections 105 and 205 or 105 and 215, as applicable.</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objectives of an Examination Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .06 </b> In conducting an examination of an entity's compliance with specified
requirements, the objectives of the practitioner are to (Ref: par. .A5)
<ol type="a">
	<li>obtain reasonable assurance about whether the entity complied
with the specified requirements, in all material respects,</li>
	<li>express an opinion in a written report about whether</li>
	<ol type="i">

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objectives of an Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .07 </b> In conducting an agreed-upon procedures engagement for which the
subject matter is compliance or internal control over compliance with specified
requirements, the objectives of the practitioner are to
<ol type="a">
	<li>pply to an entity's compliance with specified requirements or an
entity's internal control over compliance with specified require-
ments procedures that are established by specified parties who
are responsible for the sufficiency of the procedures for their pur-
poses and</li>
	<li>ssue a written report that describes the procedures applied and
the practitioner's findings.</li>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definitions</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .08 </b> For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
attributed as follows:
<p>Compliance with specified requirements.
An entity's compli-
ance with specified laws, regulations, rules, contracts, or grants.</p>
<p>Internal control over compliance.
An entity's internal control
over compliance with specified requirements. The internal con-
trol addressed in this section may include part of, but is not the
same as, internal control over financial reporting. (Ref: par. .A6)</p>
<p>Material noncompliance.
A failure to follow compliance require-
ments or a violation of prohibitions included in the specified re-
quirements that results in noncompliance that is quantitatively
or qualitatively material, either individually or when aggregated
with other noncompliance. (Ref: par. .A7)</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preconditions for Examination Engagements</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .09 </b> In order to accept an attestation engagement to examine compliance
with specified requirements, in addition to the preconditions for an examination
engagement in sections 105 and 205, the practitioner should determine that
2
(Ref: par. .A8–.A9)
<ol type="a">
	<li>management accepts responsibility for the entity's compliance
with specified requirements and the entity's internal control over
compliance.</li>
	<li>management evaluates the entity's compliance with specified re-
quirements. (Ref: par. .A9)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> 10 </b> In performing an examination under this section, the practitioner
should request from management a written assertion. If management refuses
to provide a written assertion, the practitioner should withdraw from the en-
gagement when withdrawal is possible under applicable law or regulation. (Ref:
par. .A10–.A11)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reasonable Assurance</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .11 </b> In an engagement to examine compliance with specified requirements,
the practitioner should seek to obtain reasonable assurance that the entity
complied with the specified requirements, in all material respects, including
designing the examination to detect both intentional and unintentional mate-
rial noncompliance.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Materiality</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .12 </b> As required by section 205, the practitioner should consider material-
ity when establishing the overall engagement strategy.
3
(Ref: par. .A12–.A13)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examination Procedures</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .13 </b> The practitioner should obtain an understanding of the specified re-
quirements. The practitioner's procedures to obtain that understanding should
include the following: (Ref: par. .A14)
<ol type="a">
	<li>Consideration of laws, regulations, rules, contracts, and grants
that pertain to the specified requirements, including published
requirements</li>
	<li>Consideration of knowledge about the specified requirements ob-
tained through prior engagements and regulatory reports</li>
<li>Discussion with appropriate individuals within the entity (for ex-
ample, the chief financial officer, internal auditors, legal counsel,
compliance officer, or grant or contract administrators)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .14 </b> In an engagement to examine an entity's compliance with specified re-
quirements when the entity has operations in several components (for example,
locations, branches, subsidiaries, or programs), the practitioner should deter-
mine the nature, timing, and extent of testing to be performed at individual
components. In making such a determination and in selecting the components
to be tested, the practitioner should evaluate factors such as the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The degree to which the specified requirements apply at the com-
ponent level</li>
	<li>Judgments about materiality</li>
	<li>The degree of centralization of records</li>
	<li>The effectiveness of the control environment, particularly man-
agement's direct control over the exercise of authority delegated
to others and its ability to supervise activities at various locations
effectively</li>
	<li>The nature and extent of operations conducted at the various com-
ponents</li>
	<li>The similarity of operations over compliance for different compo-
nents</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .15 </b> The practitioner should obtain an understanding of relevant portions
of internal control over compliance sufficient to plan the engagement and to
assess control risk for compliance with specified requirements. In planning the
examination, such knowledge should be used to identify types of potential non-
compliance, to consider factors that affect the risk of material noncompliance,
and to design appropriate tests of compliance. (Ref: par. .A15–.A16)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .16 </b> For engagements involving compliance with regulatory requirements,
the practitioner's procedures should include reviewing reports of relevant ex-
aminations and related communications between regulatory agencies and the
entity and, when appropriate, making inquiries of the regulatory agencies, in-
cluding inquiries about examinations in progress.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written Representations in an Examination Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .17 </b> In an examination engagement, in addition to the written represen-
tations from management required by section 205, the practitioner should re-
quest written representations from management that
4
(Ref: par. .A17)
<ol type="a">
	<li>cknowledge management's responsibility for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over compliance.</li>
	<li> state that management has performed an evaluation of the en-
tity's compliance with specified requirements.</li>
	<li>state management's interpretation of any compliance require-
ments that have varying interpretations.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .18 </b> In an examination of compliance, the practitioner should request from
management the written representations required by section 205 and para-
graph .17 of this section, even if the engaging party is not management.
5
The
alternative to obtaining the required written representations provided for in section 205 is not permitted in an engagement to examine compliance.
6
Man-
agement's refusal to furnish the written representations required by section
205 and paragraph .17 of this section constitutes a limitation on the scope of
the engagement sufficient to preclude an unmodified opinion and may be suffi-
cient to cause the practitioner to withdraw from the examination engagement,
when withdrawal is possible under applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forming the Opinion</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .19 </b> In evaluating whether the entity has complied with the specified re-
quirements, in all material respects, (or whether management's assertion about
its compliance with the specified requirements is fairly stated, in all material
respects), the practitioner should evaluate (
a
) the nature and frequency of the
noncompliance identified and (
b
) whether such noncompliance is material rel-
ative to the nature of the compliance requirements</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .20 </b> The practitioner's examination report on compliance should include

connection with an entity's compliance with specified requirements or its in-
ternal control over compliance with specified requirements. For example, the
practitioner may be engaged to provide recommendations on how to improve
the entity's compliance or related internal control. Such an engagement is gov-

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A6 </b> An entity's internal control over compliance is the process by which
management obtains reasonable assurance of compliance with specified re-
quirements. Although management's internal control may include a wide va-
riety of objectives and related policies and procedures, only some of these may
be relevant to an entity's compliance with specified requirements. An entity's
internal control over compliance may vary based on the nature of the compli-
ance requirements. For example, internal control over compliance with a capital
requirement would generally include accounting procedures, whereas internal
control over compliance with a requirement to practice nondiscriminatory hir-
ing may not include accounting procedures.</p>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A10 </b>Management's written assertion about compliance with specified re-
quirements may take many forms. Throughout this section, for example, the
phrase "management's assertion that W Company complied with [
specify com-
pliance requirement
]asof[
date
]," illustrates such an assertion. Other phrases
may also be used. A statement that is so subjective (for example,
substantially
complied
) that people having competence in and using the same or similar cri-
teria would not ordinarily be able to arrive at similar conclusions is not an
appropriate written assertion.

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A12 </b> The terms of an engagement may provide for a supplemental practi-
tioner's report of all or certain noncompliance discovered. Such terms would not
affect the practitioner's judgments about materiality in establishing the overall
engagement strategy or in forming an opinion on an entity's compliance with
specified requirements or on management's assertion about such compliance</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A13 </b> In an examination of an entity's compliance with specified require-
ments, the practitioner's consideration of materiality is affected by (
a
) the na-
ture of the compliance requirements, which may or may not be quantifiable in
monetary terms, (
b
) the nature and frequency of noncompliance identified with
appropriate consideration of sampling risk, and (
c
) qualitative considerations,
including the needs and expectations of the users of the practitioner's report.</p>

necessary to discuss the specified requirements with appropriate individuals
outside the entity (for example, a regulator or specialist).</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A15 </b> A practitioner generally obtains an understanding of the design of
specific controls by performing the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>nquiries of appropriate management, supervisory, and staff per-
sonnel</li>
	<li>Inspection of the entity's documents</li>
	<li>Observation of the entity's activities and operations</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A16 </b> The nature and extent of procedures a practitioner performs vary
from entity to entity and are influenced by factors such as the following:
<ul>
	<li>The newness and complexity of the specified requirements</li>
	<li>The practitioner's knowledge of internal control over compliance
obtained in previous professional engagements</li>
	<li>The nature of the specified requirements</li>
