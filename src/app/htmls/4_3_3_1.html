<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Derecognition Section provides guidance on determining whether and when an entity should remove an item from the financial statements. For example, the entity would derecognize an asset because it no longer has rights to the asset or it would derecognize a liability because it no longer has any obligation. </p><p>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Extinguishments of Debt </b>
</p><p id="fasb4705040">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-1   </b>As indicated in paragraph 470-50-15-4, the general guidance for the extinguishment of liabilities is contained in Subtopic 405-20 and defines transactions that the debtor shall recognize as an extinguishment of a liability. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-2   </b>A difference between the reacquisition price and the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">net carrying amount of the extinguished debt</b> shall be recognized currently in income of the period of extinguishment as losses or gains and identified as a separate item. Gains and losses shall not be amortized to future periods. If upon extinguishment of debt the parties also exchange unstated (or stated) rights or privileges, the portion of the consideration exchanged allocable to such unstated (or stated) rights or privileges shall be given appropriate accounting recognition. Moreover, extinguishment transactions between related entities may be in essence capital transactions. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-3   </b>470-50-40-3   
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Extinguishment of Convertible Debt </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-4   </b>The extinguishment of convertible debt does not change the character of the security as between debt and equity at that time. Therefore, a difference between the cash acquisition price of the debt and its net carrying amount shall be recognized currently in income in the period of extinguishment as losses or gains. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-5   </b>The guidance in this Subtopic does not apply to debt tendered to exercise detachable warrants that were originally issued with that debt if the debt is permitted to be tendered towards the exercise price of the warrants under the terms of the securities at issuance. The tendering of the debt in such a case would be accounted for in the same manner as a conversion. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Modifications and Exchanges </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-6   </b>An exchange of debt instruments with substantially different terms is a debt extinguishment and shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraph 405-20-40-1. A debtor could achieve the same economic effect as an exchange of a debt instrument by making a substantial modification of terms of an existing debt instrument. Accordingly, a substantial modification of terms shall be accounted for like an extinguishment. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-7   </b>Transactions among debt holders do not result in a modification of the original debt's terms or an exchange of debt instruments between the debtor and the debt holders and do not impact the accounting by the debtor. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-8   </b>Transactions involving the modification or exchange of debt instruments shall only result in gain or loss recognition by the debtor if the conditions for extinguishment of debt described in paragraph 405-20-40-1 are satisfied or if the guidance in this Subtopic requires that accounting. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-9   </b>Transactions involving contemporaneous exchanges of cash between the same debtor and creditor in connection with the issuance of a new debt obligation and satisfaction of an existing debt obligation by the debtor would only be accounted for as debt extinguishments if the debt instruments have substantially different terms, as defined in this Subtopic. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-10   </b>From the debtor's perspective, an exchange of debt instruments between or a modification of a debt instrument by a debtor and a creditor in a nontroubled debt situation is deemed to have been accomplished with debt instruments that are substantially different if the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument is at least 10 percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original instrument. If the terms of a debt instrument are changed or modified and the cash flow effect on a present value basis is less than 10 percent, the debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different, except in the following two circumstances: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  A modification or an exchange affects the terms of an embedded conversion option, from which the change in the fair value of the embedded conversion option (calculated as the difference between the fair value of the embedded conversion option immediately before and after the modification or exchange) is at least 10 percent of the carrying amount of the original debt instrument immediately before the modification or exchange. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  A modification or an exchange of debt instruments adds a substantive conversion option or eliminates a conversion option that was substantive at the date of the modification or exchange. (For purposes of evaluating whether an embedded conversion option was substantive on the date it was added to or eliminated from a debt instrument, see paragraphs 470-20-40-7 through 40-9.) 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-11   </b>With respect to the conditions in (a) and (b) in the preceding paragraph, this guidance does not address modifications or exchanges of debt instruments in circumstances in which the embedded conversion option is separately accounted for as a derivative under Topic 815 before the modification, after the modification, or both before and after the modification. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">470-50-40-12   </b>The following guidance shall be used to calculate the present value of the cash flows for purposes of applying the 10 percent cash flow test described in paragraph 470-50-40-10: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  The cash flows of the new debt instrument include all cash flows specified by the terms of the new debt instrument plus any amounts paid by the debtor to the creditor less any amounts received by the debtor from the creditor as part of the exchange or modification. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  If the original debt instrument or the new debt instrument has a floating interest rate, then the variable rate in effect at the date of the exchange or modification shall be used to calculate the cash flows of the variable-rate instrument. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  If either the new debt instrument or the original debt instrument is callable or puttable, then separate cash flow analyses shall be performed assuming exercise and nonexercise of the call or put. The cash flow assumptions that generate the smaller change would be the basis for determining whether the 10 percent threshold is met. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  If the debt instruments contain contingent payment terms or unusual interest rate terms, judgment shall be used to determine the appropriate cash flows. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  The discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of the cash flows is the effective interest rate, for accounting purposes, of the original debt instrument. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.  If within a year of the current transaction the debt has been exchanged or modified without being deemed to be substantially different, then the debt terms that existed a year ago shall be used to determine whether the current exchange or modification is substantially different. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">g.  The change in the fair value of an embedded conversion option resulting from an exchange of debt instruments or a modification in the terms of an existing debt instrument shall not be included in the 10 percent cash flow test. Rather, a separate test shall be performed by comparing the change in the fair value of the embedded conversion option to the carrying amount of the original debt instrument immediately before the modification, as specified in paragraph 470-50-40-10(a).
