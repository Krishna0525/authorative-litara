<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Required EPS Presentation on the Face of the Income Statement</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-2</b>  Entities with simple capital structures, that is, those with only <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">common stock</b> outstanding, shall present basic per-share amounts for income from continuing operations and for net income on the face of the income statement. All other entities shall present basic and diluted per-share amounts for income from continuing operations and for net income on the face of the income statement with equal prominence.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-3</b>  An entity that reports a discontinued operation or an extraordinary item in a period shall present basic and diluted per-share amounts for those line items either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements. An entity that does not report a discontinued operation but reports an extraordinary item in the period shall use that line item (for example, income before extraordinary items ) whenever the line item income from continuing operations is referenced by the guidance in this Subtopic.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4</b>  The terms <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">basic EPS</i> and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">diluted EPS</i> are used to identify EPS data to be presented and are not required to be captions used in the income statement. There are no explicit requirements for the terms to be used in the presentation of basic and diluted EPS; terms such as <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">earnings per common share</i> and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">earnings per common share - assuming <b>dilution</b>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Computation of Basic EPS</b>
</p><p id="26045">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-10</b>  Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">income available to common stockholders</b> (the numerator) by the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">weighted-average number of common shares outstanding</b> (the denominator) during the period. Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period shall be weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding. See Example 1 (paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">260-10-55-38</u>) for an illustration of this guidance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Income Available to Common Stockholders and Preferred Dividends</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-11</b>  Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">preferred stock</b> (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. If there is a loss from continuing operations or a net loss, the amount of the loss shall be increased by those preferred dividends. An adjustment to net income or loss for preferred stock dividends is required for all preferred stock dividends, regardless of the form of payment. Preferred dividends that are cumulative only if earned shall be deducted only to the extent that they are earned.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-11A</b>  For purposes of computing EPS in <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">consolidated financial statements</b> (both basic and diluted), if one or more less-than-wholly-owned<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">subsidiaries</b>are included in the  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">consolidated group, </b> income from continuing operations and net income shall exclude the income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. Example 7 (see paragraph 260-10-55-64) provides an example of calculating EPS when there is a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary in the consolidated group.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12</b>  Preferred stock dividends that an issuer has paid or intends to pay in its own common shares shall be deducted from net income (or added to the amount of a net loss) in computing income available to common stockholders. In certain cases, the dividends may be payable in common shares or cash at the issuerâ€™s option. The adjustment to net income (or net loss) for preferred stock dividends payable in common stock in computing income available to common stockholders is consistent with the treatment of common stock issued for goods or services.

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12A</b>  Contractual agreements (usually associated with purchase business combinations) sometimes provide for the issuance of additional common shares contingent upon certain conditions being met. Consistent with the objective that basic EPS should represent a measure of the performance of an entity over a specific reporting period, <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">contingently issuable shares</b> should be included in basic EPS only when there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued and basic EPS should not be restated for changed circumstances.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12B</b>  For a freestanding equity-classified financial instrument with a down round feature, an entity shall deduct the value of the effect of a down round feature (as recognized in accordance with paragraph 260-10-25-1 and measured in accordance with paragraphs 260-10-30-1 through 30-2) in computing income available to common stockholders when that feature has been triggered (that is, upon the occurrence of the triggering event that results in a reduction of the strike price).<br><b >Treatment of Contingently Issuable Shares in Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding </b>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12C</b>  Contractual agreements (usually associated with purchase business combinations) sometimes provide for the issuance of additional common shares contingent upon certain conditions being met. Consistent with the objective that basic EPS should represent a measure of the performance of an entity over a specific reporting period, contingently issuable shares should be included in basic EPS only when there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued and basic EPS should not be restated for changed circumstances.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-13</b>  Shares issuable for little or no cash consideration upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (contingently issuable shares) shall be considered outstanding common shares and included in the computation of basic EPS as of the date that all necessary conditions have been satisfied (in essence, when issuance of the shares is no longer contingent). Outstanding common shares that are contingently returnable (that is, subject to recall) shall be treated in the same manner as contingently issuable shares. Thus, contingently issuable shares include shares that meet any of the following criteria:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  They will be issued in the future upon the satisfaction of specified conditions.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  They have been placed in escrow and all or part must be returned if specified conditions are not met.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  They have been issued but the holder must return all or part if specified conditions are not met.

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Computation of Diluted EPS</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-16</b>  The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt. The numerator also is adjusted for any other changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares, such as profit-sharing expenses. Similar adjustments also may be necessary for certain contracts that provide the issuer or holder with a choice between settlement methods. See Example 1 (paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">260-10-55-38</u>) for an illustration of this guidance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; No Antidilution</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-17</b>  The computation of diluted EPS shall not assume conversion, exercise, or <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">contingent issuance</b> of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on EPS. Shares issued on actual conversion, exercise, or satisfaction of certain conditions for which the underlying potential common shares were antidilutive shall be included in the computation as outstanding common shares from the date of conversion, exercise, or satisfaction of those conditions, respectively. In determining whether potential common shares are dilutive or antidilutive, each issue or series of issues of potential common shares shall be considered separately rather than in the aggregate.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-18</b>  Convertible securities may be dilutive on their own but antidilutive when included with other potential common shares in computing diluted EPS. To reflect maximum potential dilution, each issue or series of issues of potential common shares shall be considered in sequence from the most dilutive to the least dilutive. That is, dilutive potential common shares with the lowest earnings per incremental share shall be included in diluted EPS before those with a higher earnings per incremental share. Example 4 (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">260-10-55-57</u>) illustrates that provision. Options and warrants generally will be included first because use of the treasury stock method does not affect the numerator of the computation. An entity that reports a discontinued operation or an extraordinary item in a period shall use income from continuing operations (adjusted for preferred dividends as described in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">260-10-45-11</u>) as the control number in determining whether those potential common shares are dilutive or antidilutive. That is, the same number of potential common shares used in computing the diluted per-share amount for income from continuing operations shall be used in computing all other reported diluted per-share amounts even if those amounts will be antidilutive to their respective basic per-share amounts. (See paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">260-10-45-3</u>). The control number excludes income from continuing operations attributable to the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary in accordance with paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">260-10-45-11A</u>. Example 14 (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">260-10-55-90</u>) provides an illustration of this guidance.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-19</b>  Including potential common shares in the denominator of a diluted per-share computation for continuing operations always will result in an antidilutive per-share amount when an entity has a loss from continuing operations or a loss from continuing operations available to common stockholders (that is, after any preferred dividend deductions). Although including those potential common shares in the other diluted per-share computations may be dilutive to their comparable basic per-share amounts, no potential common shares shall be included in the computation of any diluted per-share amount when a loss from continuing operations exists, even if the entity reports net income.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-20</b>  The control number for determining whether including potential common shares in the diluted EPS computation would be antidilutive should be income from continuing operations (or a similar line item above net income if it appears on the income statement). As a result, if there is a loss from continuing operations, diluted EPS would be computed in the same manner as basic EPS is computed, even if an entity has net income after adjusting for a discontinued operation or an extraordinary item. Similarly, if an entity has income from continuing operations but its preferred dividend adjustment made in computing income available to common stockholders in accordance with paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">260-10-45-11</u> results in a loss from continuing operations available to common stockholders, diluted EPS would be computed in the same manner as basic EPS.
