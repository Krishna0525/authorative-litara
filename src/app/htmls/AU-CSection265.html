</div><div id="auc26501">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibility to appropriately communicate to those charged with governance and management deficiencies in internal control that the auditor has identified in an audit of financial statements. This section does not impose additional responsibilities on the auditor regarding obtaining an understanding of internal control or designing and performing tests of controls over and above the requirements of section 315, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement</i>, and section 330, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained.</i> Section 260, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Auditor's Communication With Those Charged With Governance</i>, establishes further requirements and provides guidance regarding the auditor's responsibility to communicate with those charged with governance regarding the audit.
</div><div id="auc26502">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>The auditor is required to obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit when identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 1</sup> In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control. The auditor may identify deficiencies in internal control not only during this risk assessment process but also at any other stage of the audit. This section specifies which identified deficiencies the auditor is required to communicate to those charged with governance and management.
</div><div id="auc26503">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03  </b>Nothing in this section precludes the auditor from communicating to those charged with governance or management other internal control matters that the auditor has identified during the audit.

</div><div id="auc26506">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06 </b>The objective of the auditor is to appropriately communicate to those charged with governance and management deficiencies in internal control that the auditor has identified during the audit and that, in the auditor's professional judgment, are of sufficient importance to merit their respective attentions.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definitions</b>
</div><div id="auc26507">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07 </b>For purposes of generally accepted auditing standards, the following terms have the meanings attributed as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Deficiency in internal control. </b>A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A deficiency in <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">design</i> exists when (a) a control necessary to meet the control objective is missing, or (b) an existing control is not properly designed so that, even if the control operates as designed, the control objective would not be met. A deficiency in <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">operation</i> exists when a properly designed control does not operate as designed or when the person performing the control does not possess the necessary authority or competence to perform the control effectively.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Material weakness. </b>A deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significant deficiency. </b>A deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.
</div>
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requirements</b>
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determination of Whether Deficiencies in Internal Control Have Been Identified</b>
</div><div id="auc26508">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08 </b>The auditor should determine whether, on the basis of the audit work performed, the auditor has identified one or more deficiencies in internal control. (Ref: par. .A1–.A4)
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluating Identified Deficiencies in Internal Control (Ref: par. .A5–.A14)</b>
</div><div id="auc26509">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09 </b>If the auditor has identified one or more deficiencies in internal control, the auditor should evaluate each deficiency to determine, on the basis of the audit work performed, whether, individually or in combination, they constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.
</div><div id="auc26510">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.10 </b>If the auditor determines that a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control is not a material weakness, the auditor should consider whether prudent officials, having knowledge of the same facts and circumstances, would likely reach the same conclusion.
</div><div>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communication of Deficiencies in Internal Control</b>
</div><div id="auc26511">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11 </b>The auditor should communicate in writing to those charged with governance on a timely basis significant deficiencies and material weaknesses identified during the audit, including those that were remediated during the audit. (Ref: par. .A15–.A20 and .A28)
</div><div id="auc26512">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12 </b>The auditor also should communicate to management at an appropriate level of responsibility, on a timely basis (Ref: par. .A21 and .A28)

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">a. in writing, significant deficiencies and material weaknesses that the auditor has communicated or intends to communicate to those charged with governance, unless it would be inappropriate to communicate directly to management in the circumstances. (Ref: par. .A16 and .A22–.A23)
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">b. in writing or orally, other deficiencies in internal control identified during the audit that have not been communicated to management by other parties and that, in the auditor's professional judgment, are of sufficient importance to merit management's attention. If other deficiencies in internal control are communicated orally, the auditor should document the communication. (Ref: par. .A24–.A27)
</div>
</div><div id="auc26513">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.13 </b>The communications referred to in paragraphs .11–.12 should be made no later than 60 days following the report release date. (Ref: par. .A16–.A17)
</div><div id="auc26514">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.14 </b>The auditor should include in the auditor's written communication of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses (Ref: par. .A29–.A33)

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">a. the definition of the term <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">material weakness</i> and, when relevant, the definition of the term <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">significant deficiency</i>.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">b. a description of the significant deficiencies and material weaknesses and an explanation of their potential effects. (Ref: par. .A29)
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">c. sufficient information to enable those charged with governance and management to understand the context of the communication. In particular, the auditor should include in the communication the following elements that explain that (Ref: par. .A30–.A31)

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">i. the purpose of the audit was for the auditor to express an opinion on the financial statements.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">ii. the audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">iii. the auditor is not expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">iv. the auditor's consideration of internal control was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.
</div>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">d. an appropriate alert, in accordance with section 905, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alert That Restricts the Use of the Auditor's Written Communication</i>.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sup> (Ref: par. .A32)

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc265a5">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A5  </b>The severity of a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control depends not only on whether a misstatement has actually occurred but also on

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>the magnitude of the potential misstatement resulting from the deficiency or deficiencies and</li>

<li>whether there is a reasonable possibility that the entity's controls will fail to prevent, or detect and correct, a misstatement of an account balance or disclosure. A reasonable possibility exists when the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses may exist even though the auditor has not identified misstatements during the audit.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc265a6">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A6  </b>Factors that affect the magnitude of a misstatement that might result from a deficiency, or deficiencies, in internal control include, but are not limited to, the following:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>The financial statement amounts or total of transactions exposed to the deficiency</li>

<li>The volume of activity (in the current period or expected in future periods) in the account or class of transactions exposed to the deficiency</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc265a7">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A7  </b>In evaluating the magnitude of the potential misstatement, the maximum amount by which an account balance or total of transactions can be overstated generally is the recorded amount, whereas understatements could be larger.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc265a8">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A8  </b>Risk factors affect whether there is a reasonable possibility that a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control will result in a misstatement of an account balance or disclosure. The factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>The nature of the financial statement accounts, classes of transactions, disclosures, and assertions involved</li>

<li>The cause and frequency of the exceptions detected as a result of the deficiency, or deficiencies, in internal control</li>

<li>The susceptibility of the related asset or liability to loss or fraud</li>

<li>The subjectivity, complexity, or extent of judgment required to determine the amount involved</li>

<li>The interaction or relationship of the control(s) with other controls</li>

<li>The interaction with other deficiencies in internal control</li>

<li>The possible future consequences of the deficiency, or deficiencies, in internal control</li>

<li>The importance of the controls to the financial reporting process—for example

<p align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>general monitoring controls (such as oversight of management)</li>

<li>controls over the prevention and detection of fraud</li>

<li>controls over the selection and application of significant accounting policies</li>

<li>controls over significant transactions with related parties</li>

<li>controls over significant transactions outside the entity's normal course of business</li>

<li>controls over the period-end financial reporting process (such as controls over nonrecurring journal entries)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc265a9">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A9  </b>The evaluation of whether a deficiency in internal control presents a reasonable possibility of misstatement may be made without quantifying the probability of occurrence as a specific percentage or range. Also, in many cases, the probability of a small misstatement will be greater than the probability of a large misstatement.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc265a10">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A10  </b>Controls may be designed to operate individually, or in combination, to effectively prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements. <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 3</sup> For example, controls over accounts receivable may consist of both automated and manual controls designed to operate together to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements in the account balance. A deficiency in internal control on its own may not be sufficiently important to constitute a significant deficiency or a material weakness. However, a combination of deficiencies affecting the same significant account or disclosure, relevant assertion, or component of internal control may increase the risks of misstatement to such an extent to give rise to a significant deficiency or material weakness.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc265a11">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A11  </b>Indicators of material weaknesses in internal control include

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>identification of fraud, whether or not material, on the part of senior management;</li>

<li>restatement of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of a material misstatement due to fraud or error;</li>

<li>identification by the auditor of a material misstatement of the financial statements under audit in circumstances that indicate that the misstatement would not have been detected by the entity's internal control; and</li>

<li>ineffective oversight of the entity's financial reporting and internal control by those charged with governance.</li>
