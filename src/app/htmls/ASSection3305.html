      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.01</b> This section applies to auditors’ reports issued in connection with the following:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. Financial statements that are prepared in conformity with a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles (paragraphs .02 through .10)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. Specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement (paragraphs .11 through .18)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. Compliance with aspects of contractual agreements or regulatory requirements related to audited financial statements (paragraphs .19 through .21)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. Financial presentations to comply with contractual agreements or regulatory provisions (paragraphs .22 through .30)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">e. Financial information presented in prescribed forms or schedules that require a prescribed form of auditor's reports (paragraphs .32 and .33)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Financial Statements Prepared in Conformity With a Comprehensive Basis of Accounting Other Than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.02</b> The standards of the PCAOB are applicable when an auditor conducts an audit of and reports on any financial statement. A financial statement may be, for example, that of a corporation, a consolidated group of corporations, a combined group of affiliated entities, a not-for-profit organization, a governmental unit, an estate or trust, a partnership, a proprietorship, a segment of any of these, or an individual. The term <em>financial statement</em> refers to a presentation of financial data, including accompanying notes, derived from accounting records and intended to communicate an entity's economic resources or obligations at a point in time or the changes therein for a period of time in conformity with a comprehensive basis of accounting. For reporting purposes, the independent auditor should consider each of the following types of financial presentations to be a financial statement:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. Balance sheet</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. Statement of income or statement of operations</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. Statement of cash flows</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. Statement of changes in owners’ equity</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">e. Statement of assets and liabilities that does not include owners’ equity accounts</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">f. Statement of revenue and expenses</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">g. Summary of operations</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">h. Statement of operations by product lines</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">i. Statement of cash receipts and disbursements</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.03</b> An independent auditor's judgment concerning the overall presentation of financial statements should be applied within an identifiable framework (<em>see</em> AS 2815, <em>The Meaning of “Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”</em>). Normally, the framework is provided by generally accepted accounting principles, and the auditor's judgment in forming an opinion is applied accordingly (<em>see </em>AS 2815.05). In some circumstances, however, a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles may be used.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.04</b> For purposes of this section, a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles is one of the following—
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. A basis of accounting that the reporting entity uses to comply with the requirements or financial reporting provisions of a governmental regulatory agency to whose jurisdiction the entity is subject. An example is a basis of accounting insurance companies use pursuant to the rules of a state insurance commission.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. A basis of accounting that the reporting entity uses or expects to use to file its income tax return for the period covered by the financial statements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. The cash receipts and disbursements basis of accounting, and modifications of the cash basis having substantial support, such as recording depreciation on fixed assets or accruing income taxes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. A definite set of criteria having substantial support that is applied to all material items appearing in financial statements, such as the price-level basis of accounting.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">Unless one of the foregoing descriptions applies, reporting under the provisions of paragraph .05 is not permitted.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Reporting on Financial Statements Prepared in Conformity With an Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting (OCBOA)</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.05</b> When reporting on financial statements prepared in conformity with a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles, as defined in paragraph .04, an independent auditor should include in the report—
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. A title that includes the word <em>independent</em>.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. A paragraph that—</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(1) States that the financial statements identified in the report were audited.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(2) States that the financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management<sup>2</sup> and that the auditor is responsible for expressing an opinion on the financial statements based on the audit.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. A paragraph that—</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(1) States that the audit was conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and includes an identification of the United States of America as the country of origin of those standards (for example, the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(2) States that those standards require that the auditor plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(3) States that an audit includes—</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(a) Examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(b) Assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(c) Evaluating the overall financial statement presentation (<em>see </em>paragraph .09).
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(4) States that the auditor believes that his or her audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">e. A paragraph that—</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(1) States the basis of presentation and refers to the note to the financial statements that describes the basis (<em>see</em> paragraphs .09 and .10).
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(2) States that the basis of presentation is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">f. A paragraph that expresses the auditor's opinion (or disclaims an opinion) on whether the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the basis of accounting described. If the auditor concludes that the financial statements are not presented fairly on the basis of accounting described or if there has been a limitation on the scope of the audit, he or she should disclose all the substantive reasons for the conclusion in an explanatory paragraph(s) (preceding the opinion paragraph) of the report and should include in the opinion paragraph the appropriate modifying language and a reference to such explanatory paragraph(s).<sup>3</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">g. If the financial statements are prepared in conformity with the requirements or financial reporting provisions of a governmental regulatory agency (<em>see </em>paragraph .04<em>a), a separate paragraph at the end of the report stating that the report is intended solely for the information and use of those within the entity and the regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction the entity is subject, and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. Such a paragraph is appropriate even though by law or regulation the auditor's report may be made a matter of public record</em>.<sup>4</sup> The auditor may use this form of report only if the financial statements and report are intended solely for use by those within the entity and one or more regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction the entity is subject.<sup>5</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">h. The manual or printed signature of the auditor's firm.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">i. The city and state (or city and country, in the case of non-U.S. auditors) from which the auditor's report has been issued.<sup>5A</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">j. The date.<sup>6</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.06</b> Unless the financial statements meet the conditions for presentation in conformity with a “comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles” as defined in paragraph .04, the auditor should use the standard form of report (<em>see</em> paragraph .08 of AS 3101, <em>Reports on Audited Financial Statements</em>) modified as appropriate because of the departures from generally accepted accounting principles.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.07</b> Terms such as <em>balance sheet, statement of financial position, statement of income, statement of operations</em>, and <em>statement of cash flows</em>, or similar unmodified titles are generally understood to be applicable only to financial statements that are intended to present financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, the auditor should consider whether the financial statements that he or she is reporting on are suitably titled. For example, cash basis financial statements might be titled <em>statement of assets and liabilities arising from cash transactions</em>, or <em>statement of revenue collected and expenses paid</em>, and a financial statement prepared on a statutory or regulatory basis might be titled <em>statement of income—statutory basis</em>. If the auditor believes that the financial statements are not suitably titled, the auditor should disclose his or her reservations in an explanatory paragraph of the report and qualify the opinion.
      </p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities arising from cash transactions of XYZ Company as of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, and the related statements of revenue collected and expenses paid for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Evaluating the Adequacy of Disclosure in Financial Statements Prepared in Conformity With an Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.09</b> When reporting on financial statements prepared on a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles, the auditor should consider whether the financial statements (including the accompanying notes) include all informative disclosures that are appropriate for the basis of accounting used. The auditor should apply essentially the same criteria to financial statements prepared on an other comprehensive basis of accounting as he or she does to financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, the auditor's opinion should be based on his or her judgment regarding whether the financial statements, including the related notes, are informative of matters that may affect their use, understanding, and interpretation as discussed in AS 2815.04.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.10</b> Financial statements prepared on an other comprehensive basis of accounting should include, in the accompanying notes, a summary of significant accounting policies that discusses the basis of presentation and describes how that basis differs from generally accepted accounting principles. However, the effects of the differences between generally accepted accounting principles and the basis of presentation of the financial statements that the auditor is reporting on need not be quantified. In addition, when the financial statements contain items that are the same as, or similar to, those in financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, similar informative disclosures are appropriate. For example, financial statements prepared on an income tax basis or a modified cash basis of accounting usually reflect depreciation, long-term debt and owners’ equity. Thus, the informative disclosures for depreciation, long-term debt and owners’ equity in such financial statements should be comparable to those in financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. When evaluating the adequacy of disclosures, the auditor should also consider disclosures related to matters that are not specifically identified on the face of the financial statements, such as (<em>a</em>) related party transactions, (<em>b</em>) restrictions on assets and owners’ equity, (<em>c</em>) subsequent events, and (<em>d</em>) uncertainties.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Specified Elements, Accounts, or Items of a Financial Statement</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.11</b> An independent auditor may be requested to express an opinion on one or more specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement. In such an engagement, the specified element(s), account(s), or item(s) may be presented in the report or in a document accompanying the report. Examples of one or more specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement that an auditor may report on based on an audit made in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB include rentals, royalties, a profit participation, or a provision for income taxes.<sup>8</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.12</b> When expressing an opinion on one or more specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement, the auditor should plan and perform the audit and prepare his or her report with a view to the purpose of the engagement. With the exception of the requirement in AS 3101.08<em>h</em>, the standards of the PCAOB are applicable to any engagement to express an opinion on one or more specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement. AS 3101.08<em>h</em>, which requires that the auditor's report state whether the financial statements are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, is applicable only when the specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement are intended to be presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.13</b> An engagement to express an opinion on one or more specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement may be undertaken as a separate engagement or in conjunction with an audit of financial statements. In either case, an auditor expresses an opinion on each of the specified elements, accounts, or items encompassed by the auditor's report; therefore, the measurement of materiality must be related to each individual element, account, or item reported on rather than to the aggregate thereof or to the financial statements taken as a whole. Consequently, an audit of a specified element, account, or item for purposes of reporting thereon is usually more extensive than if the same information were being considered in conjunction with an audit of financial statements taken as a whole. Also, many financial statement elements are interrelated, for example, sales and receivables; inventory and payables; and buildings and equipment and depreciation. The auditor should be satisfied that elements, accounts, or items that are interrelated with those on which he or she has been engaged to express an opinion have been considered in expressing an opinion.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.14</b> The auditor should not express an opinion on specified elements, accounts, or items included in financial statements on which he or she has expressed an adverse opinion or disclaimed an opinion based on an audit, if such reporting would be tantamount to expressing a piecemeal opinion on the financial statements (<em>see</em> AS 3101.64). However, an auditor would be able to express an opinion on one or more specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement provided that the matters to be reported on and the related scope of the audit were not intended to and did not encompass so many elements, accounts, or items as to constitute a major portion of the financial statements. For example, it may be appropriate for an auditor to express an opinion on an entity's accounts receivable balance even if the auditor has disclaimed an opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole. However, the report on the specified element, account, or item should be presented separately from the report on the financial statements of the entity.

If the audit was made in conjunction with an audit of the company's financial statements, the paragraph should so state and indicate the date of the auditor's report on those financial statements. Furthermore, any departure from the standard report on those statements should also be disclosed if considered relevant to the presentation of the specified element, account or item.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">(2) States that the specified elements, accounts, or items are the responsibility of the Company's management and that the auditor is responsible for expressing an opinion on the specified elements, accounts or items based on the audit.</p>

If the auditor concludes that the specified elements, accounts, or items are not presented fairly on the basis of accounting described or if there has been a limitation on the scope of the audit, the auditor should disclose all the substantive reasons for that conclusion in an explanatory paragraph(s) (preceding the opinion paragraph) of the report and should include in the opinion paragraph appropriate modifying language and a reference to such explanatory paragraph(s).<sup>12</sup></p>

They usually also require the borrower to furnish annual financial statements that have been audited by an independent auditor. In some instances, the lenders or their trustees may request assurance from the independent auditor that the borrower has complied with certain covenants of the agreement relating to accounting matters. The independent auditor may satisfy this request by giving negative assurance relative to the applicable covenants based on the audit of the financial statements. This assurance may be given in a separate report or in one or more paragraphs of the auditor's report accompanying the financial statements. Such assurance, however, should not be given unless the auditor has audited the financial statements to which the contractual agreements or regulatory requirements relate and should not extend to covenants that relate to matters that have not been subjected to the audit procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements.<sup>19</sup> In addition, such assurance should not be given if the auditor has expressed an adverse opinion or disclaimed an opinion on the financial statements to which these covenants relate.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Special-Purpose Financial Presentations to Comply With Contractual Agreements or Regulatory Provisions </b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.22</b> An auditor is sometimes asked to report on special-purpose financial statements prepared to comply with a contractual agreement<sup>23</sup> or regulatory provisions. In most circumstances, these types of presentations are intended solely for the use of the parties to the agreement, regulatory bodies, or other specified parties. This section discusses reporting on these types of presentations, which include the following:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. A special-purpose financial presentation prepared in compliance with a contractual agreement or regulatory provision that does not constitute a complete presentation of the entity's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, but is otherwise prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or an other comprehensive basis of accounting (paragraphs .23 through .26).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. A special-purpose financial presentation (may be a complete set of financial statements or a single financial statement) prepared on a basis of accounting prescribed in an agreement that does not result in a presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or an other comprehensive basis of accounting (paragraphs .27 through .30).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Financial Statements Prepared on a Basis of Accounting Prescribed in a Contractual Agreement or Regulatory Provision That Results in an Incomplete Presentation But One That is Otherwise in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or an Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.23</b> A governmental agency may require a schedule of gross income and certain expenses of an entity's real estate operation in which income and expenses are measured in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, but expenses are defined to exclude certain items such as interest, depreciation, and income taxes. Such a schedule may also present the excess of gross income over defined expenses. Also, a buy-sell agreement may specify a schedule of gross assets and liabilities of the entity measured in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, but limited to the assets to be sold and liabilities to be transferred pursuant to the agreement.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.24</b> Paragraph .02 of this section defines the term <em>financial statement</em> and includes a list of financial presentations that an auditor should consider to be financial statements for reporting purposes. The concept of specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement discussed in paragraphs .11 through .18, on the other hand, refers to accounting information that is part of, but significantly less than, a financial statement. The financial presentations described above and similar presentations should generally be regarded as financial statements, even though, as indicated above, certain items may be excluded. Thus, when the auditor is asked to report on these types of presentations, the measurement of materiality for purposes of expressing an opinion should be related to the presentations taken as a whole. Further, the presentations should differ from complete financial statements only to the extent necessary to meet special purposes for which they were prepared. In addition, when these financial presentations contain items that are the same as, or similar to, those contained in a full set of financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, similar informative disclosures are appropriate (<em>see</em> paragraphs .09 and .10). The auditor should also be satisfied that the financial statements presented are suitably titled to avoid any implication that the special-purpose financial statements on which he or she is reporting are intended to present financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

A loan agreement, for example, may require the borrower to prepare consolidated financial statements in which assets, such as inventory, are presented on a basis that is not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or an other comprehensive basis of accounting. An acquisition agreement may require the financial statements of the entity being acquired (or a segment of it) to be prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles except for certain assets, such as receivables, inventories, and properties for which a valuation basis is specified in the agreement.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.31</b> Certain circumstances, while not affecting the auditor's unqualified opinion, may require that the auditor add additional explanatory language to the special report. These circumstances include the following:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. <em>Lack of Consistency in Accounting Principles. </em>If there has been a change in accounting principles or in the method of their application,<sup>35</sup> the auditor should add an explanatory paragraph to the report (following the opinion paragraph) that describes the change and refers to the note to the financial presentation (or specified elements, accounts, or items thereof) that discusses the change and its effect thereon<sup>36</sup> if the accounting change is considered relevant to the presentation. Guidance on reporting in this situation is contained in AS 3101.16 through .18.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. <em>Going Concern Uncertainties. </em>If the auditor has substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time not to exceed one year beyond the date of the financial statement, the auditor should add an explanatory paragraph after the opinion paragraph of the report only if the auditor's substantial doubt is relevant to the presentation.<sup>39</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. <em>Other Auditors. </em>When the auditor decides to make reference to the report of another auditor as a basis, in part, for his or her opinion, the auditor should disclose that fact in the introductory paragraph of the report and should refer to the report of the other auditors in expressing his or her opinion. Guidance on reporting in this situation is contained in AS 3101.12 and .13.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. <em>Comparative Financial Statements (or Specified Elements, Accounts, or Items Thereof)</em>.If the auditor expresses an opinion on prior-period financial statements (or specified elements, accounts, or items thereof) that is different from the opinion he or she previously expressed on that same information, the auditor should disclose all of the substantive reasons for the different opinion in a separate explanatory paragraph preceding the opinion paragraph of the report. Guidance on reporting in this situation is contained in AS 3101.68 and .69.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">As in reports on financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, the auditor may add an explanatory paragraph to emphasize a matter regarding the financial statements (or specified elements, accounts, or items thereof).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Financial Information Presented in Prescribed Forms or Schedules</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.32</b> Printed forms or schedules designed or adopted by the bodies with which they are to be filed often prescribe the wording of an auditor's report. Many of these forms are not acceptable to independent auditors because the prescribed form of auditor's report does not conform to the applicable professional reporting standards. For example, the prescribed language of the report may call for statements by the auditor that are not consistent with the auditor's function or responsibility.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.33</b> Some report forms can be made acceptable by inserting additional wording; others can be made acceptable only by complete revision. When a printed report form calls upon an independent auditor to make a statement that he or she is not justified in making, the auditor should reword the form or attach a separate report. In those situations, the reporting provisions of paragraph .05 may be appropriate.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Effective Date</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.34</b> This section is effective for reports issued on or after July 1, 1989. Early application of the provisions of this section is permissible.

In some instances, a document containing the auditor's report may include a statement by management regarding its responsibility for the presentation of the financial statements. Nevertheless, the auditor's report should state that the financial statements are management's responsibility. However, the statement about management's responsibility should not be further elaborated upon in the auditor's standard report or referenced to management's report.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">3. Paragraph .31 discusses other circumstances that may require that the auditor add additional explanatory language to the special report.</p>

Public record, for purposes of auditor's reports on financial statements of a regulated entity that are prepared in accordance with the financial reporting provisions of a government regulatory agency, includes circumstances in which specific requests must be made by the public to obtain access to or copies of the report.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">5. If the financial statements and report are intended for use by parties other than those within the entity and one or more regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction the entity is subject, the auditor should follow the guidance in AS 3310, <em>Special Reports on Regulated Companies</em>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">17. <em>See</em> paragraph .16.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">18. When the auditor is engaged to test compliance with laws and regulations in accordance with <em>Government Auditing Standards</em> issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Yellow Book), he or she should follow guidance contained in AS 6110, <em>Compliance Auditing Considerations in Audits of Recipients of Governmental Financial Assistance</em>.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">19. When the auditor is engaged to provide assurance on compliance with contractual agreements or regulatory provisions that relate to matters that have not been subjected to the audit procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements, the auditor should refer to the guidance in AT section 601, <em>Compliance Attestation</em>.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">20. <em>See</em> footnote 1.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">20A. <em>See</em> footnote 5A.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">21. <em>See</em> footnote 6.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">22. When the auditor's report on compliance with contractual agreements or regulatory provisions is included in the report that expresses the auditor's opinion on the financial statements, the last two paragraphs of this report are examples of the paragraphs that should follow the opinion paragraph of the auditor's report on the financial statements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">23. A contractual agreement as discussed in this section is an agreement between the client and one or more third parties other than the auditor.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">24. <em>See</em> footnote 1.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">25. Sometimes the auditor's client may not be the person responsible for the financial statements on which the auditor is reporting. For example, when the auditor is engaged by the buyer to report on the seller's financial statements prepared in conformity with a buy-sell agreement, the person responsible for the financial statements may be the seller's management. In this case, the wording of this statement should be changed to clearly identify the party that is responsible for the financial statements reported on.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">26. <em>See</em> footnote 2.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">27. If the basis of presentation is an other comprehensive basis of accounting, the paragraph should state that the basis of presentation is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles and that it is not intended to be a complete presentation of the entity's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses on the basis described.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">28. Paragraph .31 discusses other circumstances that may require that the auditor add additional explanatory language to the special report.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">28A. <em>See</em> footnote 5A.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">29. <em>See</em> footnote 6.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">30. <em>See</em> footnote 1.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">31. <em>See</em> footnote 25.

      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">33. Paragraph .31 discusses other circumstances that may require that the auditor add additional explanatory language to the special report.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">33A. <em>See</em> footnote 5A.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">34. <em>See</em> footnote 6.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">35. When financial statements (or specified elements, accounts, or items thereof) have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in prior years, and the entity changes its method of presentation in the current year by preparing its financial statements in conformity with an other comprehensive basis of accounting, the auditor need not follow the reporting guidance in this subparagraph. However, the auditor may wish to add an explanatory paragraph to the report to highlight (1) a difference in the basis of presentation from that used in prior years or (2) that another report has been issued on the entity's financial statements prepared in conformity with another basis of presentation (for example, when cash basis financial statements are issued in addition to GAAP financial statements).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">36. A change in the tax law is not considered to be a change in accounting principle for which the auditor would need to add an explanatory paragraph, although disclosure may be necessary.</p>
