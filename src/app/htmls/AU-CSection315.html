<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc31504">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04  </b>For purposes of generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), the following terms have the meanings attributed as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assertions. </b>Representations by management, explicit or otherwise, that are embodied in the financial statements as used by the auditor to consider the different types of potential misstatements that may occur.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Business risk. </b>A risk resulting from significant conditions, events, circumstances, actions, or inactions that could adversely affect an entity's ability to achieve its objectives and execute its strategies or from the setting of inappropriate objectives and strategies.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Internal control. </b>A process effected by those charged with governance, management, and other personnel that is designed to provide reasonable assurance about the achievement of the entity's objectives with regard to the reliability of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control over safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition may include controls relating to financial reporting and operations objectives. <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</sup>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevant assertion. </b>A financial statement assertion that has a reasonable possibility of containing a misstatement or misstatements that would cause the financial statements to be materially misstated. The determination of whether an assertion is a relevant assertion is made without regard to the effect of internal controls.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Risk assessment procedures. </b>The audit procedures performed to obtain an understanding of the entity and its environment, including the entity's internal control, to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, at the financial statement and relevant assertion levels.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significant risk. </b> An identified and assessed risk of material misstatement that, in the auditor's professional judgment, requires special audit consideration.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09  </b>During planning, the auditor should consider the results of the assessment of the risk of material misstatement due to fraud<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sup> along with other information gathered in the process of identifying the risks of material misstatements.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc31510">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.10  </b>When the auditor intends to use information obtained from the auditor's previous experience with the entity and from audit procedures performed in previous audits, the auditor should determine whether changes have occurred since the previous audit that may affect its relevance to the current audit.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc31511">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11  </b>The engagement partner and other key engagement team members should discuss the susceptibility of the entity's financial statements to material misstatement and the application of the applicable financial reporting framework to the entity's facts and circumstances.

If the auditor identifies risks of material misstatement that management failed to identify, the auditor should evaluate whether an underlying risk existed that the auditor expects would have been identified by the entity's risk assessment process. If such a risk exists, the auditor should obtain an understanding of why that process failed to identify it and evaluate whether the process is appropriate to its circumstances or determine if a significant deficiency or material weakness exists in internal control regarding the entity's risk assessment process.

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">The way in which internal control is designed, implemented, and maintained varies with an entity's size and complexity.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A45  </b>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations specific to smaller, less complex entities. </i>Smaller entities may use less structured means and simpler processes and procedures to achieve their objectives. For example, smaller entities with active management involvement in the financial reporting process may not have extensive descriptions of accounting procedures or detailed written policies. For some entities, in particular very small entities, the owner-manager (the proprietor of an entity who is involved in running the entity on a day-to-day basis) may perform functions that in a larger entity would be regarded as belonging to several of the components of internal control. Therefore, the components of internal control may not be clearly distinguished within smaller entities, but their underlying purposes are equally valid.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc315a46">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A46  </b>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations of internal control.  </i>Internal control, no matter how effective, can provide an entity with only reasonable assurance about achieving the entity's financial reporting objectives. The likelihood of their achievement is affected by the inherent limitations of internal control. These include the realities that human judgment in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns in internal control can occur because of human error. For example, an error in the design of, or in the change to, a control may exist. Equally, the operation of a control may not be effective, such as when information produced for the purposes of internal control (for example, an exception report) is not effectively used because the individual responsible for reviewing the information does not understand its purpose or fails to take appropriate action.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc315a47">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A47  </b>Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the collusion of two or more people or inappropriate management override of internal control. For example, management may enter into undisclosed agreements with customers that alter the terms and conditions of the entity's standard sales contracts, which may result in improper revenue recognition. Also, edit checks in a software program that are designed to identify and report transactions that exceed specified credit limits may be overridden or disabled.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc315a48">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A48  </b>Further, in designing and implementing controls, management may make judgments on the nature and extent of the controls it chooses to implement and the nature and extent of the risks it chooses to assume.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A49  </b>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations specific to smaller, less complex entities. </i>Smaller entities often have fewer employees, which may limit the extent to which segregation of duties is practicable. However, in a small owner-managed entity, the owner-manager may be able to exercise more effective oversight than in a larger entity.

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>Controls in a manual system may include such procedures as approvals and reviews of transactions and reconciliations and follow-up of reconciling items. Alternatively, an entity may use automated procedures to initiate, authorize, record, process, and report transactions, in which case records in electronic format replace paper documents.</li>

<li>Controls in IT systems consist of a combination of automated controls (for example, controls embedded in computer programs) and manual controls. Further, manual controls may be independent of IT or may use information produced by IT. They also may be limited to monitoring the effective functioning of IT and automated controls and to handling exceptions. When IT is used to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report transactions or other financial data for inclusion in financial statements, the systems and programs may include controls related to the corresponding assertions for material accounts or may be critical to the effective functioning of manual controls that depend on IT.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;">An entity's mix of manual and automated elements in internal control varies with the nature and complexity of the entity's use of IT.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc315a56">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A56  </b>Generally, IT benefits an entity's internal control by enabling an entity to

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>consistently apply predefined business rules and perform complex calculations in processing large volumes of transactions or data;</li>

<li>enhance the timeliness, availability, and accuracy of information;</li>

<li>facilitate the additional analysis of information;</li>

<li>enhance the ability to monitor the performance of the entity's activities and its policies and procedures;</li>

<li>reduce the risk that controls will be circumvented; and</li>

<li>enhance the ability to achieve effective segregation of duties by implementing security controls in applications, databases, and operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc315a57">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A57  </b>IT also poses specific risks to an entity's internal control, including, for example

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>reliance on systems or programs that are inaccurately processing data, processing inaccurate data, or both.</li>

<li>unauthorized access to data that may result in destruction of data or improper changes to data, including the recording of unauthorized or nonexistent transactions or inaccurate recording of transactions. Particular risks may arise when multiple users access a common database.</li>

<li>the possibility of IT personnel gaining access privileges beyond those necessary to perform their assigned duties, thereby breaking down segregation of duties.</li>

<li>unauthorized changes to data in master files.</li>

<li>unauthorized changes to systems or programs.</li>

<li>failure to make necessary changes to systems or programs.</li>

<li>inappropriate manual intervention.</li>

<li>potential loss of data or inability to access data as required.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc315a58">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A58  </b>Manual elements in internal control may be more suitable when judgment and discretion are required, such as for the following circumstances:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>Large, unusual, or nonrecurring transactions</li>

<li>Circumstances in which errors are difficult to define, anticipate, or predict</li>

<li>Changing circumstances that require a control response outside the scope of an existing automated control</li>

<li>Monitoring of the effectiveness of automated controls</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc315a59">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A59  </b>Manual elements in internal control may be less reliable than automated elements because they can be more easily bypassed, ignored, or overridden, and they also are more prone to simple errors and mistakes. Consistency of application of a manual control element cannot, therefore, be assumed. Manual control elements may be less suitable for the following circumstances:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>High volume or recurring transactions or in situations in which errors that can be anticipated or predicted can be prevented, or detected and corrected, by control parameters that are automated</li>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A108  </b>Risks of material misstatement at the financial statement level refer to risks that relate pervasively to the financial statements as a whole and potentially affect many assertions. Risks of this nature are not necessarily risks identifiable with specific assertions at the class of transactions, account balance, or disclosure level. Rather, they represent circumstances that may increase the risks of material misstatement at the assertion level (for example, through management override of internal control). Financial statement level risks may be especially relevant to the auditor's consideration of the risks of material misstatement arising from fraud.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc315a109">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A109  </b>Risks at the financial statement level may derive, in particular, from a deficient control environment (although these risks also may relate to factors such as declining economic conditions). For example, deficiencies such as management's lack of competence may have a more pervasive effect on the financial statements and may require an overall response by the auditor.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A110  </b>The auditor's understanding of internal control may raise doubts about the auditability of an entity's financial statements. For example

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>concerns about the integrity of the entity's management may be so serious to cause the auditor to conclude that the risk of management misrepresentation in the financial statements is such that an audit cannot be conducted.</li>

<li>concerns about the condition and reliability of an entity's records may cause the auditor to conclude that it is unlikely that sufficient appropriate audit evidence will be available to support an unmodified opinion on the financial statements.</li>

<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevant assertions</i> are assertions that have a reasonable possibility of containing a misstatement or misstatements that would cause the financial statements to be materially misstated and, as such, are assertions that have a meaningful bearing on whether the account is fairly stated. Not all assertions pertaining to a particular account balance will always be relevant. For example, valuation may not be relevant to the cash account unless currency translation is involved; however, existence and completeness are always relevant. Similarly, valuation may not be relevant to the gross amount of the accounts receivable balance but is relevant to the related allowance accounts. Additionally, the auditor might, in some circumstances, focus on the presentation and disclosure assertions separately in connection with the period-end financial reporting process.
