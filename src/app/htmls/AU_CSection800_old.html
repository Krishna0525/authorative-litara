</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.13  </b>Section 315, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement</i>, requires the auditor to obtain an understanding of the entity's selection and application of accounting policies.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 5</sup> In the case of special purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with a contractual basis of accounting, the auditor should obtain an understanding of any significant interpretations of the contract that management made in the preparation of those financial statements. An interpretation is significant when adoption of another reasonable interpretation would have produced a material difference in the information presented in the financial statements.
</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Appendix B — Fair Presentation and Adequate Disclosures</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A34  </b>When special purpose financial statements contain items that are the same as, or similar to, those in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), paragraph .17 requires the auditor to evaluate whether, the financial statements include informative disclosures similar to those required by GAAP. The auditor is also required to evaluate whether additional disclosures, beyond those specifically required by the framework, related to matters that are not specifically identified on the face of the financial statements or other disclosures are necessary for the financial statements to achieve fair presentation. This appendix provides guidance, in addition to paragraphs .A19-.A22, on evaluating the adequacy of disclosures in financial statements prepared in accordance with a special purpose framework, including matters related to the presentation of financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">If special purpose financial statements contain items for which GAAP would require disclosure, the financial statements may either provide the relevant disclosure that would be required for those items in a GAAP presentation or provide information that communicates the substance of that disclosure. Likewise, if GAAP sets forth requirements that apply to the presentation of financial statements, special purpose financial statements may either comply with those requirements or provide information that communicates the substance of those requirements, without modifying the format of the special purpose financial statements. This may result in substituting qualitative information for some of the quantitative information required for GAAP presentations. For example: 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Disclosure of the repayment terms of significant long-term borrowings may sufficiently communicate information about future principal reduction without providing the summary of principal reduction during each of the next five years.</li>

<li>Information about the effects of accounting changes, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items could be disclosed in a note to the financial statements without following the GAAP presentation requirements in the statement of results of operations, using those terms, or disclosing net-of-tax effects.</li>

<li>Instead of showing expenses by their functional classifications in certain industries, a statement of activities could present expenses according to their natural classifications, and a note to the statement could use estimated percentages to communicate information about expenses incurred by the major program and supporting services.</li>

<li>Instead of showing the amounts of, and changes in, the unrestricted and temporarily and permanently restricted classes of net assets in certain industries, a statement of assets and liabilities could report total net assets or fund balances, a related statement of activities could report changes in those totals, and a note to the financial statements could provide information, using estimated or actual amounts or percentages, about the restrictions on those amounts and on any deferred restricted amounts, describe the major restrictions, and provide information about significant changes in restricted amounts.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">For special purpose financial statements, GAAP disclosure requirements that are not relevant to the measurement of the item need not be considered. To illustrate:
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Fair value disclosures for debt and equity securities would not be relevant when the basis of presentation does not adjust the cost of such securities to their fair value.</li>

<li>Disclosures related to actuarial calculations for contributions to defined benefit plans would not be relevant in financial statements prepared in accordance with the cash or tax basis of accounting.</li>

<li>Disclosures related to the use of estimates would not be relevant in a presentation that has no estimates, such as the cash basis of accounting.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Special purpose financial statements may not include a statement of cash flows. If a presentation of cash receipts and disbursements is presented in a format similar to a statement of cash flows or if the entity chooses to present such a statement, the statement would either conform to the requirements for a GAAP presentation or communicate their substance. As an example, the statement of cash flows might disclose noncash acquisitions through captions on its face.
