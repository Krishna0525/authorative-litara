<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introduction</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .01 </b> This section contains performance and reporting requirements and application
guidance for all agreed-upon procedures engagements. The requirements
and guidance in this section supplement the requirements and guidance
in section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .02 </b> An agreed-upon procedures engagement is one in which a practitioner
is engaged to issue, or does issue, a practitioner's report of findings based on
specific agreed-upon procedures applied to subject matter for use by specified
parties. Because the specified parties require that findings be independently
derived, the services of a practitioner are obtained to perform procedures and
report the practitioner's findings. The specified parties determine the procedures
they believe to be appropriate to be applied by the practitioner. Because
the needs of specified parties may vary widely, the nature, timing, and extent of
the agreed-upon procedures may vary, as well; consequently, the specified parties
assume responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures because they
best understand their own needs. In an engagement performed under this section,
the practitioner does not perform an examination or a review and does not
provide an opinion or conclusion. Instead, the report on agreed-upon procedures
is in the form of procedures and findings.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .03 </b> When a practitioner performs services pursuant to an engagement to
apply agreed-upon procedures to subject matter as part of or in addition to
another form of service, this section applies only to those services described
herein; other professional standards would apply to the other services. Other
services may include an audit, review, or compilation of a financial statement,
another attestation service performed pursuant to the attestation standards, or
a nonattestation service. A practitioner's report on applying agreed-upon procedures
to subject matter may be combined with a report on such other services,
provided the types of services can be clearly distinguished, and the applicable
standards for each service are followed. (Ref: par. .A1)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .04 </b> This section does not apply to engagements to issue letters (commonly
referred to as comfort letters) to underwriters and certain other requesting parties.1</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective Date</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .05 </b> This section is effective for agreed-upon procedures reports dated on or after May 1, 2017.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objectives</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .06 </b> In conducting an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the objectives of the practitioner are to.
<ol type="a">
	<li>apply to the subject matter procedures that are established by
specified parties who are responsible for the sufficiency of the procedures
for their purposes; (Ref: par. .A2)</li>
	<li>issue a written practitioner's report that describes the procedures
applied and the practitioner's findings; and</li>
	<li>communicate further as required by relevant AT-C sections.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definition</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .07 </b> For purposes of this section, the following term has the meaning attributed as follows:
<p><b>Nonparticipant party.</b> An additional specified party the practitioner
is requested to add as a user of the practitioner's report
subsequent to the completion of the agreed-upon procedures
engagement. (The term specified party is defined in section
105.2)</p>
</p>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requirements</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conduct of an Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .08 </b> In performing an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner
should comply with this section, section 105, and any subject-matter
section that is relevant to the engagement. A subject-matter AT-C section is relevant
to the engagement when it is in effect, and the circumstances addressed
by the AT-C section exist. (Ref: par. .A3–.A4)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preconditions for an Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .09 </b> Section 105 indicates that a practitioner must be independent when
performing an attestation engagement in accordance with the attestation standards
unless the practitioner is required by law or regulation to accept the
engagement and report on the subject matter or assertion.3 When the practitioner
is not independent but is required by law or regulation to accept an
agreed-upon procedures engagement and report on the procedures performed
and findings obtained, the practitioner's report should specifically state that
the practitioner is not independent. The practitioner is neither required to provide,
nor precluded from providing, the reasons for the lack of independence;
however, if the practitioner chooses to provide the reasons for the lack of independence,
the practitioner should include all the reasons therefor.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .10 </b> In order to establish that the preconditions for an agreed-upon procedures
engagement are present, the practitioner should determine that the
following conditions, in addition to the preconditions identified in section 105,
are present:4 (Ref: par. .A5–.A6)
<ol type="a">
	<li>The specified parties agree on the procedures performed, or to be
performed, by the practitioner.</li>
	<li>The specified parties take responsibility for the sufficiency of the
agreed-upon procedures for their purposes. (Ref: par. .A6)</li>
	<li>The practitioner determines that the procedures can be performed
and reported on in accordance with this section.</li>
	<li>The procedures to be applied to the subject matter are expected
to result in reasonably consistent findings using the criteria.</li>
	<li>When applicable, the practitioner agrees to apply any materiality
limits established by the specified parties for reporting purposes</li>
	<li>Use of the practitioner's report is to be restricted to the specified
parties.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .11 </b> The practitioner should not accept an agreed-upon procedures engagement when the specified parties do not agree upon the procedures performed, or to be performed, or do not take responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures for their purposes. (See paragraphs .38–.40 for the requirements and
related application guidance on satisfying these requirements when the practitioner
is requested to add a nonparticipant party.) (Ref: par. .A6)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agreeing on the Terms of the Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .12 </b> The practitioner should agree upon the terms of the engagement with
the engaging party. The agreed-upon terms of the engagement should be specified
in sufficient detail in an engagement letter or other suitable form of written
agreement. (Ref: par. .A7)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .13 </b> The agreement should be addressed to the engaging party</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .14 </b> The agreed-upon terms of the engagement should include the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The nature of the engagement</li>
	<li>Identification of the subject matter or assertion, the responsible
party, and the criteria to be used (Ref: par. .A8)</li>
	<li>Identification of specified parties</li>
	<li>Acknowledgment by the specified parties of their responsibility
for the sufficiency of the procedures (Ref: par. .A6)</li>
	<li>The responsibilities of the practitioner (Ref: par. .A9–.A10)</li>
	<li>A statement that the engagement will be conducted in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants
</li>
	<li>Agreement on procedures by enumerating (or referring to) the
procedures</li>
	<li>Disclaimers expected to be included in the practitioner's report</li>
	<li>Use restrictions</li>
	<li>Assistance to be provided to the practitioner</li>
	<li>Involvement of a practitioner's external specialist, if applicable</li>
	<li>Agreed-upon materiality limits specified by the specified parties,
if applicable</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requesting a Written Assertion</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .15 </b> The practitioner should request from the responsible party a written assertion about the measurement or evaluation of the subject matter against the criteria. (Ref: par. .A11–.A15)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .16 </b> If the engaging party is not the responsible party, and the practitioner
is aware that the responsible party refuses to provide the practitioner with
a written assertion, the written agreement required by paragraph .12 should
make clear that no such assertion will be provided to the practitioner. (Ref:
par. .A15)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Procedures to Be Performed</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .17 </b> The procedures agreed upon pursuant to paragraph .14 g should specify the nature, timing, and extent of the procedures. (Ref: par. .A16–.A20)</p>
<p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .18 </b> In some circumstances, the procedures agreed upon evolve or are modified over the course of the engagement. In such circumstances, the practitioner should amend the engagement letter or other suitable form of written agreement, as applicable, to reflect the modified procedures.</p>
<p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .19 </b> The practitioner should not agree to perform procedures that are open to varying interpretations. Terms of uncertain meaning (such as general review ,limited review,check,or test) should not be used in describing the procedures unless such terms are defined within the agreed-upon procedures. (Ref: par.
.A21)</p>
<p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .20 </b> The practitioner should obtain evidence from applying the agreed upon procedures to provide a reasonable basis for the finding or findings expressed in the practitioner's report but need not perform additional procedures
outside the scope of the engagement to gather additional evidence.</p>
<p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the Work of a Practitioner’s External Specialist</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .21 </b> The practitioner and the specified parties should explicitly agree to the
involvement of a practitioner's external specialist if assisting a practitioner in
the performance of an agreed-upon procedures engagement. (Ref: par. .A22–
.A24)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .22 </b> The practitioner's report should describe the nature of the assistance
provided by the practitioner's external specialist. 
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the Work of Internal Auditors or Other Practitioners</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .23 </b> The agreed-upon procedures to be enumerated or referred to in the practitioner's report should be performed entirely by the engagement team or other practitioners. (Ref: par. .A25–.A27)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Findings</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .24 </b> A practitioner should present the results of applying agreed-upon pro-
cedures to specific subject matter in the form of findings.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .25 </b> The practitioner's report should not express an opinion or conclusion
about whether the subject matter is in accordance with (or based on) the cri-
teria or whether the assertion is fairly stated, for example, the report should
not state, "Nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the  subject matter is not in accordance with (or based on) the criteria, in all mate-
rial respects, or that the assertion is not fairly stated, in all material respects."</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .26 </b> The practitioner should report all findings from application of the
agreed-upon procedures. Any agreed-upon materiality limits should be de-
scribed in the practitioner's report. (Ref: par. .A28)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .27 </b> The practitioner should avoid vague or ambiguous language in report-
ing findings. (Ref: par. .A29)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written Representations</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .28 </b> The practitioner should request from the responsible party written representations in the form of a letter addressed to the practitioner. The representations should (Ref: par. .A30)
<ol type="a">
<li>include the responsible party's assertion about the subject matter
based on the criteria.</li>
<li>state that all known matters contradicting the subject matter or
assertion and any communication from regulatory agencies or
others affecting the subject matter or assertion have been dis-
closed to the practitioner, including communications received be-
tween the end of the period addressed in the written assertion
and the date of the practitioner's report.</li>
<li>acknowledge responsibility for</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li>the subject matter and the assertion;</li>
	<li>selecting the criteria, when applicable; and</li>
	<li>determining that such criteria are appropriate for the re-
sponsible party's purposes.</li>
</ol>
<li>state that it has provided the practitioner with access to all
records relevant to the subject matter and the agreed-upon pro-
cedures.</li>
<li>state that the responsible party has disclosed to the practitioner
other matters as the practitioner deems appropriate.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .29 </b> When the engaging party is not the responsible party, the practitioner should request written representations from the engaging party, in addition to those requested from the responsible party, in the form of a letter addressed to the practitioner. The representations should
<ol type="a">
	<li>acknowledge that the responsible party is responsible for the sub-
ject matter and assertion.</li>

known events subsequent to the period (or point in time) of the
subject matter being reported on that would have a material effect
on the subject matter or assertion.</li>
	<li>address other matters as the practitioner deems appropriate.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .30 </b> The date of the written representations should be as of the date of the
practitioner's report. The written representations should address the subject
matter and periods covered by the practitioner's findings.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requested Written Representations Not Provided or Not Reliable</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .31 </b> When the engaging party is the responsible party, and one or more
of the requested written representations are not provided, or the practitioner
concludes that there is sufficient doubt about the competence, integrity, ethical
values, or diligence of those providing the written representations, or the prac-
titioner concludes that the written representations are otherwise not reliable,
the practitioner should
<ol type="a">
	<li>discuss the matter with the appropriate party(ies);</li>
	<li>reevaluate the integrity of those from whom the representations
were requested or received and evaluate the effect, if any, on the

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .37 </b> When circumstances impose restrictions on the performance of the
agreed-upon procedures, the practitioner should attempt to obtain agreement
from the specified parties for modification of the agreed-upon procedures. When
such agreement cannot be obtained (for example, when the agreed-upon proce-
dures are published by a regulatory agency that will not modify the procedures),
the practitioner should describe any restrictions on the performance of proce-
dures in the practitioner's report or withdraw from the engagement.</p>

agreed-upon procedures, if in connection with the application, and through the
completion of, the agreed-upon procedures engagement, matters come to the

parties. In some instances, a separate restricted use report may be included in
a document that also contains a general use report. The inclusion of a separate

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A3 </b> For example, if a practitioner were performing agreed-upon procedures related to an entity's compliance with requirements of specified laws, regulations, rules, contracts, or grants, section 105, this section, and section 315, Compliance Attestation , would be relevant.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A4 </b> Although independence is required for agreed-upon procedures engagements, the "Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements Performed in Accordance With SSAEs" interpretation (ET sec. 1.297.020) establishes indepen-
dence requirements unique to such engagements.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A5 </b> To satisfy the requirements that the specified parties agree upon, the
procedures performed or to be performed, and that the specified parties take re-
sponsibility for the sufficiency of the agreed-upon procedures for their purposes,
the practitioner ordinarily communicates directly with and obtains affirmative
acknowledgment from each of the specified parties. For example, this may be
accomplished by meeting with the specified parties or by distributing a draft
of the anticipated practitioner's report or a copy of an engagement letter to the
specified parties and obtaining their agreement. If the practitioner is not able
to communicate directly with all the specified parties, the practitioner may sat-
isfy these requirements by applying any one or more of the following or similar
procedures:
<ul>
	<li>Compare the procedures to be applied to written requirements of
the specified parties.</li>
	<li>Discuss the procedures to be applied with appropriate represen-
tatives of the specified parties involved.</li>
	<li>Review relevant contracts with or correspondence from the speci-
fied parties.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A6 </b> Specified parties are responsible for the sufficiency (nature, timing,
and extent) of the agreed-upon procedures because they best understand their
own needs. The specified parties assume the risk that such procedures might
be insufficient for their purposes. In addition, the specified parties assume the
risk that they might misunderstand or otherwise inappropriately use findings
properly reported by the practitioner.
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agreeing on the Terms of the Engagement (Ref:
par. .12 and .14 b and e )</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A7 </b> It is in the interests of both the engaging party and the practitioner to document the agreed-upon terms of the engagement before the commencement of the engagement to help avoid misunderstandings. The form and content of the engagement letter or other suitable form of written agreement will vary
with the engagement circumstances.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A8 </b> The criteria may be indicated in the procedures as opposed to being
described separately.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A9 </b> The responsibility of the practitioner is to carry out the procedures and report the findings in accordance with the attestation standards. The practitioner assumes the risk that misapplication of the procedures may result in inappropriate findings being reported. Furthermore, the practitioner assumes
the risk that appropriate findings may not be reported or may be reported in-
accurately. The practitioner's risks can be reduced through adequate planning
and supervision and due professional care in performing the procedures, accu-
mulating the findings, and preparing the practitioner's report.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A10 </b> The practitioner has no responsibility to determine the differences between the agreed-upon procedures to be performed and the procedures that the practitioner would have determined to be necessary had the practitioner been engaged to perform another form of attestation engagement. The proce-
dures that the practitioner agrees to perform pursuant to an agreed-upon pro-
cedures engagement may be more or less extensive than the procedures that
the practitioner would determine to be necessary had he or she been engaged
to perform another form of engagement.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requesting a Written Assertion (Ref: par. .15–.16)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A11 </b> Situations may arise in which the current responsible party was not
present during some or all of the period covered by the practitioner's report.
Such persons may contend that they are not in a position to provide a written
assertion that covers the entire period because they were not in place during
some or all of the period. This fact, however, does not diminish such persons'
responsibilities for the subject matter as a whole. Accordingly, the requirement
for the practitioner to request a written assertion from the responsible party
that covers the entire relevant period(s) still applies.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A12 </b> Paragraph .28
a requires the practitioner to request a written representation from the responsible party that is the same as the responsible party's assertion. If the responsible party provides the practitioner with the written representation in paragraph .28 a , the practitioner need not request a separate written assertion, unless a separate written assertion is called for by the engagement circumstances.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A13 </b> In an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the procedures that the
practitioner is asked to perform frequently consist of comparing information
from one source with information from another source to determine whether
they agree. For that reason, the criteria identified in the assertion might be the
agreement of one amount with another amount.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A14 </b> The following are examples of assertions the responsible party might
make related to accounts receivable in the engagement that results in the prac-
titioner's report illustrated in example 2 of paragraph .A48:
<ul>
	<li>General ledger account 250, "Accounts Receivable," as of Decem-
ber 31, 20XX, accurately summarizes the accounts receivable aged
trial balance, which accurately summarizes individual customer
account balances as of that date.</li>
	<li>The accounts receivable subsidiary ledger as of December 31,
20XX accurately summarizes individual account balances in the
aged trial balance of accounts receivable as of that date.</li>
	<li>The aged trial balance of accounts receivable as of December 31,
20XX, accurately ages outstanding invoices in the accounts receiv-
able subledger as of that date.</li>
	<li>The accounts receivable trial balance as of December 31, 20XX,
accurately summarizes amounts due from customers at that date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, a single assertion such as the following might be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The accounts receivable aged trial balance as of December 31,
20XX, accurately presents the general ledger balance and the
amounts and ages of individual customer balances as of that date.</li>
	<li>Additional assertions would be necessary for the engagement re-
sulting in the report in example 2 of paragraph .A48, for example,
an assertion about cash, or in the case of a single assertion, the
assertion would need to be modified to address cash.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A15 </b> Paragraph .36 contains reporting requirements for situations in
which the responsible party refuses to provide the practitioner with a written
assertion.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Procedures to Be Performed (Ref: par. .17 and .19)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A16 </b> The procedures that the practitioner and specified parties agree upon
may be as limited or as extensive as the specified parties desire. However, mere
reading of an assertion or specified information about the subject matter does
not constitute a procedure sufficient to permit a practitioner to report on the
results of applying agreed-upon procedures.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A17 </b> Examples of appropriate procedures include the following:
<ul>
	<li>Execution of a sampling application after agreeing on relevant pa-
rameters</li>
	<li>Inspection of specified documents evidencing certain types of
transactions or detailed attributes thereof</li>
	<li>Confirmation of specific information with third parties</li>
	<li>Comparison of documents, schedules, or analyses with certain
specified attributes</li>
	<li>Performance of specific procedures on work performed by others</li>
	<li>Performance of mathematical computations</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A18 </b> Examples of inappropriate procedures include the following:
<ul>
	<li>Mere reading of the work performed by others solely to describe
their findings</li>
	<li>Evaluating the competency or objectivity of another party</li>
	<li>Confirmation of specific information with third parties</li>
	<li>Obtaining an understanding about a particular subject</li>
	<li>Interpreting documents outside the scope of the practitioner's pro-
fessional expertise</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A19 </b> If the practitioner is selecting a sample, stating the size of the sam-
ple and how the selection was made (after agreement by the specified parties
regarding the relevant parameters) contributes to the specificity of the descrip-
tion of procedures performed (for example, 50 items starting at the eighth item
and selecting every fifteenth item thereafter or invoices issued from May 1 to
July 31, 20XX).</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A20 </b> Examples of other information the practitioner may include are the
date the procedure was performed and the sources of information used in per-
forming the procedure.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A21 </b> To avoid vague or ambiguous language, the procedures to be per-
formed are characterized by the action to be taken at a level of specificity suf-
ficient for a reader to understand the nature and extent of the procedures per-
formed. Examples of acceptable descriptions of actions are the following:
<ul>
	<li>Inspect</li>
	<li>Confirm</li>
	<li>Compare</li>
	<li>Agree</li>
	<li>Trace</li>
	<li>Inquire</li>
	<li>Recalculate</li>

	<li>Mathematically check</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, the following descriptions of actions (unless defined to indicate the
nature, timing, and extent of the procedures associated with these actions) gen-
erally are not acceptable because they are not sufficiently precise or have an
uncertain meaning:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Note</li>
	<li>Review</li>
	<li>General review</li>
	<li>Limited review</li>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A22 </b> The practitioner's education and experience enable the practitioner
to be knowledgeable about business matters in general, but the practitioner is
not expected to have the expertise of a person trained for or qualified to engage
in the practice of another profession or occupation. In certain circumstances, it
may be appropriate to involve a practitioner's external specialist to assist the
practitioner in the performance of one or more procedures. The following are
examples of such circumstances:
<ul>
	<li>An attorney providing assistance concerning the interpretation of
legal terminology in laws, regulations, rules, contracts, or grants</li>
	<li>A medical specialist providing assistance in understanding the
characteristics of diagnosis codes documented in patient medical
records</li>
	<li>An environmental engineer providing assistance in interpreting
environmental remedial action regulatory directives that may af-
fect the agreed-upon procedures applied to an environmental lia-
bilities account in a financial statement</li>
	<li>A geologist providing assistance in distinguishing between the
physical characteristics of a generic minerals group related to in-
formation to which the agreed-upon procedures are applied</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A23 </b> The agreement regarding the involvement of a practitioner's external specialists may be reached when obtaining agreement on the procedures performed, or to be performed, and acknowledgment of responsibility for the
sufficiency of the procedures, as discussed in paragraph .10b.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A24 </b> A practitioner may agree to apply procedures to the report or
work product of a practitioner's external specialist that does not constitute
assistance by the external specialist to the practitioner in an agreed-upon pro-
cedures engagement. For example, the practitioner may make reference to in-
formation contained in a report of a practitioner's external specialist in describ-
ing an agreed-upon procedure. However, it is inappropriate for the practitioner
to agree to merely read the external specialist's report solely to describe or
repeat the findings or to take responsibility for all or a portion of any proce-
dures performed by a practitioner's external specialist or the external special-
ist's work product.</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A25 </b> Internal auditors or other personnel may prepare schedules and ac-
cumulate data or provide other information for the practitioner's use in per-
forming the agreed-upon procedures. Also, internal auditors may perform and
report separately on procedures that they have carried out. Such procedures
may be similar to those that a practitioner may perform under this section.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A26 </b> A practitioner may agree to perform procedures on information doc-
umented in the working papers of internal auditors. For example, the practi-
tioner may agree to
<ul>
	<li>repeat all or some of the procedures.</li>
	<li>determine whether the internal auditors' documentation indi-
cates procedures performed and whether the findings documented
are presented in a report by the internal auditors.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A27 </b> It is inappropriate for the practitioner to
<ul>
	<li>agree to merely read the internal auditors' report solely to de-
scribe or repeat their findings.</li>
	<li>take responsibility for all or a portion of any procedures performed
by internal auditors by reporting those findings as the practi-

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A28 </b> The concept of materiality does not apply to findings to be reported
in an agreed-upon procedures engagement unless the definition of materiality
is agreed to by the specified parties. An example of language that describes a
materiality limit is "For purposes of performing these agreed-upon procedures,
no exceptions were reported for differences of $1,000 or less resulting solely

<p>The procedures and the associated findings are as follows:</p>
<p><b>Cash</b></p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>or the four bank accounts listed below, we obtained</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>the December 31, 20XX, bank reconciliations from XYZ
Company management and</li>
		<li>the December 31, 20XX, general ledger from XYZ Com-
pany management.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>We performed the following procedures:</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Obtained a bank confirmation directly from each bank of
the cash on deposit as of December 31, 20XX</li>
		<li>Compared the balance confirmed by the bank to the
amount shown on the respective bank reconciliations.</li>
		<li>Mathematically checked the bank reconciliations</li>
		<li>Compared the cash balances per book listed in the recon-
ciliations below to the respective general ledger account
balances.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>We obtained the accounts receivable aged trial balance as of De-
cember 31, 20XX, from XYZ Company (attached as exhibit A).We
mathematically checked that the individual customer account
balance subtotals in the aged trial balance of accounts receivable
agreed to the total accounts receivable per the aged trial balance.
We compared the total accounts receivable per the accounts re-
ceivable aged trial balance to the total accounts receivable per
general ledger account 250.</li>
	<li>We obtained the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger as of De-
cember 31, 20XX, from XYZ Company. We compared the individ-
ual customer account balance subtotals shown in the accounts re-
ceivable aged trial balance (exhibit A) as of December 31, 20XX, to
the balances shown in the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger.</li>
	<li>e selected 50 customer account balances from exhibit A by start-
ing at the eighth item and selecting every fifteenth item there-
after until 50 were selected. The sample size selected represents
9.8 percent of the aggregate amount of the customer account bal-
ances. We obtained the corresponding invoices from XYZ Com-
pany and traced the aging (according to invoice dates) for the 50
customer account balances shown in exhibit A to the details of
outstanding invoices in the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger.</li>
	<li>e mailed confirmations directly to the customers representing
the 150 largest customer account balance subtotals selected from
the accounts receivable aged trial balance, and we received re-
sponses as indicated below. As agreed, any individual differences
in a customer account balance of less than $300 were to be con-
sidered minor, and no further procedures were performed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the 150 customer balances confirmed, we received responses
from 140 customers; 10 customers did not reply.</p>
<p>No exceptions were identified in 120 of the confirmations received.
The differences in the remaining 20 confirmation replies were less
than $300. </p>
<p>For the 10 customers that did not reply, we traced the items con-
stituting the outstanding customer account balance to invoices
and supporting shipping documents.</p>
