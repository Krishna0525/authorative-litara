Regulatory Basis Financial Statements Intended for General Use</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A28</b> Special purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with a
regulatory basis of accounting may be intended for general use. Such special
purpose financial statements are intended for general use when the financial
statements together with the auditor's report are intended for use by parties
other than those within the entity and the regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction
the entity is subject or when the financial statements together with the
auditor's report are distributed by the entity to parties other than the regulatory
agencies to whose jurisdiction the entity is subject, either voluntarily or
upon specific request. In such circumstances, the emphasis-of-matter and othermatter
paragraphs described in paragraphs .19–.20 are not required because
the auditor is required, in accordance with paragraph .21, to express an opinion
about whether the special purpose financial statements are prepared in accordance
with GAAP and an opinion about whether the financial statements are
prepared in accordance with the special purpose framework.</p>

Auditor’s Report Prescribed by Law or Regulation</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
A29</b> The auditor may be required to comply with legal or regulatory requirements
in addition to GAAS. When this is the case, the auditor may be
required to use a layout, form, or wording in the auditor's report that differs
from that described in this section, such as when printed forms or schedules
designed or adopted by the bodies with which they are to be filed prescribe the
wording of the auditor's report.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A30</b> When the differences between the legal or regulatory requirements
and GAAS relate only to the layout, form, and wording of the auditor's report
and, at a minimum, each of the elements identified in paragraph .22 are included
in the auditor's report, the auditor's report may refer to GAAS. Accordingly,
in such circumstances the auditor is considered to have complied with
the requirements of GAAS, even when the layout, form, and wording used in
the auditor's report are specified by legal or regulatory reporting requirements.
Section 210 addresses circumstances in which law or regulation prescribes the
layout, form, or wording of the auditor's report in terms that are significantly
different from the requirements of GAAS.18</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A31</b> Some report forms can be made acceptable by inserting additional
wording to include the elements identified in paragraph .22. Other report forms
can be made acceptable only by complete revision because the prescribed language
of the report calls for statements by the auditor that are not consistent
with the auditor's function or responsibility; for example, a report form that
requests the auditor to certify the financial statements.
.A32 This guidance can be applied to other circumstances, for example,
reports on financial statements prepared in accordance with a general purpose
framework for which a specific layout, form, or wording of the auditor's report
is required.</p>
