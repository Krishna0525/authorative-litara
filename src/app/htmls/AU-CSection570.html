<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Statement on Auditing Standards</b>
</div><div id="aud57001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01 </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibilities in an audit of financial statements with respect to evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This section applies to all audits of financial statements, regardless of whether the financial statements are prepared in accordance with a general purpose or a special purpose framework.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</sup> This section does not apply to an audit of financial statements based on the assumption of liquidation (for example, when [a] an entity is in the process of liquidation, [b] the owners have decided to commence dissolution or liquidation, or [c] legal proceedings, including bankruptcy, have reached a point at which dissolution or liquidation is probable).<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sup>
</div><div id="aud57002">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02 </b>Continuation of an entity as a going concern is assumed in financial reporting in the absence of significant information to the contrary. Ordinarily, information that significantly contradicts the going concern assumption relates to the entity's inability to continue to meet its obligations as they become due without substantial disposition of assets outside the ordinary course of business, restructuring of debt, externally forced revisions of its operations, or similar actions.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<i>Identifying Conditions or Events That Indicate Substantial Doubt Could Exist (Ref: par. .09)</i>
</b>
</div><div id="aud570a01">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A1 </b>It is not necessary to design audit procedures solely to identify conditions or events that, when considered in the aggregate, indicate there could be substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The results of audit procedures designed and performed to identify and assess risk in accordance with section 315, gather audit evidence in response to assessed risks in accordance with section 330, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained</i>, and complete the audit are expected to be sufficient for that purpose. The following are examples of procedures that may identify such conditions or events:

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>Analytical procedures</li>
<li>Review of subsequent events</li>
<li>Review of compliance with the terms of debt and loan agreements</li>
<li>Reading of minutes of meetings of stockholders, board of directors, and important committees of the board</li>
<li>Inquiry of an entity's legal counsel about litigation, claims, and assessments</li>
<li>Confirmation with related and third parties of the details of arrangements to provide or maintain financial support</li>

</ul>
</div><div id="aud570a02">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A2 </b>In performing audit procedures such as those described in paragraph .A1 of this section, the auditor may identify information about certain conditions or events that, when considered in the aggregate, indicate there could be substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The significance of such conditions or events will depend on the circumstances, and some conditions or events may have significance only when viewed in conjunction with others. The following are examples of such conditions or events:

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>
<i>Negative trends</i>—for example, recurring operating losses, working capital deficiencies, negative cash flows from operating activities, adverse key financial ratios</li>

<li>
<i>Other indications of possible financial difficulties</i>—for example, default on loan or similar agreements, arrearages in dividends, denial of usual trade credit from suppliers, restructuring of debt, noncompliance with statutory capital requirements, need to seek new sources or methods of financing or to dispose of substantial assets</li>

<li>
<i>Internal matters</i>—for example, work stoppages or other labor difficulties, substantial dependence on the success of a particular project, uneconomic long-term commitments, need to significantly revise operations</li>

<li>
<i>External matters that have occurred</i>—for example, legal proceedings, legislation, or similar matters that might jeopardize an entity's ability to operate; loss of a key franchise, license, or patent; loss of a principal customer or supplier; uninsured or underinsured catastrophe such as a drought, earthquake, or flood</li>
</ul>

<i>Consideration of Management's Plans When the Auditor Believes There Is Substantial Doubt (Ref: par. .10)</i>

the following:

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>Plans to dispose of assets
<ul>
<li>Restrictions on disposal of assets, such as covenants limiting such transactions in loan or similar agreements or encumbrances against assets</li>
<li>Apparent marketability of assets that management plans to sell</li>
<li>Possible direct or indirect effects of disposal of assets</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Plans to borrow money or restructure debt
<ul>
<li>Availability of debt financing, including existing or committed credit arrangements, such as lines of credit or arrangements for factoring receivables or sale-leaseback of assets</li>
<li>Existing or committed arrangements to restructure or subordinate debt or to guarantee loans to the entity</li>
<li>Possible effects on management's borrowing plans of existing restrictions on additional borrowing or the sufficiency of available collateral</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Plans to reduce or delay expenditures
<ul>
<li>Apparent feasibility of plans to reduce overhead or administrative expenditures, to postpone maintenance or research and development projects, or to lease rather than purchase assets</li>
<li>Possible direct or indirect effects of reduced or delayed expenditures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plans to increase ownership equity
<ul>
<li>Apparent feasibility of plans to increase ownership equity, including existing or committed arrangements to raise additional capital</li>
