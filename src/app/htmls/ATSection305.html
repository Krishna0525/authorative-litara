<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objectives of an Examination Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .07 </b> In conducting an examination of prospective financial information, the
objectives of the practitioner are to
<ol type="a">
	<li>obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material re-
spects,</li>
<ol type="i">
	<li>he prospective financial information is presented in accor-
dance with the guidelines for the presentation of prospec-
tive financial information established by the AICPA
(AICPA presentation guidelines) (Ref: par. .A1) and</li>
	<li>the assumptions underlying the forecast are suitably sup-
ported and provide a reasonable basis for the responsible
party's forecast, or the assumptions underlying the projec-
tion are suitably supported and provide a reasonable basis
for the responsible party's projection, given the hypotheti-
cal assumptions. (Ref: par. .A2)</li>

<li>express an opinion in a written report on the matters in para-
graph .07

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objectives of an Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .08 </b> In conducting an examination of prospective financial information, the
objectives of the practitioner are to
<ol type="a">
	<li>apply to the prospective financial information procedures that are
established by specified parties who are responsible for the suffi-
ciency of the procedures for their purposes and</li>
	<li>ssue a written report that describes the procedures applied and
the practitioner's findings</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definitions</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .09 </b> For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings attributed as follows:
<p><b>Entity.</b>
Any unit, existing or to be formed, for which financial state-
ments could be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles or special purpose frameworks. For exam-
ple, an entity can be an individual, partnership, corporation, trust,
estate, association, or governmental unit. (Ref: par. .A3)</p>
<p><b>Financial forecast.</b>
Prospective financial statements that present,
to the best of the responsible party's knowledge and belief, an en-
tity's expected financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows. A financial forecast is based on the responsible party's as-
sumptions reflecting conditions it expects to exist and the course
of action it expects to take. A financial forecast may be expressed
in specific monetary amounts as a single-point estimate of fore-
casted results or as a range, when the responsible party selects
key assumptions to form a range within which it reasonably ex-
pects, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the item or items
subject to the assumptions to actually fall. If a forecast contains a range, the range is not selected in a biased or misleading man-
ner (for example, a range in which one end is significantly less
expected than the other). (Ref: par. .A4)</p>
<p><b>Financial  projection.</b>
Prospective  financial  statements  that
present, to the best of the responsible party's knowledge and be-
lief, given one or more hypothetical assumptions, an entity's ex-
pected financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A
financial projection is sometimes prepared to present one or more
hypothetical courses of action for evaluation, as in response to a
question such as, "What would happen if...?" A financial projection
is based on the responsible party's assumptions reflecting condi-
tions it expects would exist and the course of action it expects
would be taken, given one or more hypothetical assumptions. A
projection, like a forecast, may contain a range. (Ref: par. .A5–.A6)</p>
<p><b>Guide.</b>
The AICPA Guide
Prospective Financial Information.</p>
<p><b>Hypothetical assumption.</b>
An assumption used in a financial pro-
jection or in a partial presentation of projected information to
present a condition or course of action that is not necessarily ex-
pected to occur, but is consistent with the purpose of the projec-
tion.</p>
<p><b>Key factors.</b>
The significant matters on which an entity's future re-
sults are expected to depend. Such factors are basic to the entity's
operations and, thus, encompass matters that affect, among other
things, the entity's sales, production, service, and financing activ-
ities. Key factors serve as a foundation for prospective financial
information and are the bases for the assumptions.</p>
<p><b>Partial presentation.</b>
A presentation of prospective financial infor-
mation that excludes one or more of the applicable items required
for prospective financial statements as described in chapter 8 of
the guide. (Ref: par. .A7)</p>
<p><b>Presentation guidelines.</b>
The criteria for the presentation and dis-
closure of prospective financial information. (Ref: par. .A8</p>
<p><b>Prospective financial information.</b>
Any financial information
about the future. The information may be presented as complete
financial statements or limited to one or more elements, items, or
accounts.</p>
<p><b>Prospective financial statements.</b>
Either financial forecasts or
financial projections, including the summaries of significant as-
sumptions and accounting policies. Although prospective finan-
cial statements may cover a period that has partially expired,
statements for periods that have completely expired are not con-
sidered to be prospective financial statements. Pro forma finan-
cial statements and partial presentations are not considered to
be prospective financial statements. (Ref: par. .A9–.A10)</p>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requirements</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preconditions for an Examination Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .10 </b> Because a financial projection is not appropriate for general use, a
practitioner should not agree to the use of the practitioner's name in conjunc-
tion with a financial projection that the practitioner believes will be distributed to those who will not be negotiating directly with the responsible party. (Ref:
par. .A4–.A5 and .A11)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .11
 </b> Unless required by law or regulation to do so, a practitioner should not
accept an engagement to examine
<ol type="a">
	<li>a forecast or projection, unless the responsible party has agreed
to disclose the significant assumptions</li>
	<li> financial projection, unless the responsible party has agreed to
identify in the presentation which of the assumptions are hypo-
thetical and to describe the limitations on the usefulness of the
projection.</li>
	<li> partial presentation that does not describe the limitations on
the usefulness of the presentation.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .12
 </b>A practitioner should not examine a forecast or projection that dis-
closes none of the significant assumptions. If after accepting the engagement
the practitioner determines that the forecast or projection discloses none of
the significant assumptions, the practitioner should withdraw from the engage-
ment, unless required by law or regulation to report on the financial forecast
or projection, in which case, the practitioner should express an adverse opinion
in the practitioner's report.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .13
 </b>If after accepting the engagement, the practitioner determines that the
forecast or projection fails to disclose one or more of the significant assumptions,
the practitioner should describe the assumption(s) in the practitioner's report
and express an adverse opinion.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .14
 </b>If after accepting the engagement the practitioner determines that a
projection fails to identify which of the assumptions are hypothetical or describe
the limitations on the usefulness of the projection, the practitioner should with-
draw from the engagement, unless required by law or regulation to report on
the projection, in which case, the practitioner should express an adverse opin-
ion in the practitioner's report.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Training and Proficiency</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .15 </b> The practitioner should understand the guidelines for the preparation and presentation of prospective financial statements contained in the guide.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .16 </b> The practitioner should possess or obtain a level of knowledge of the industry and the accounting principles and practices of the industry in which the entity operates, or will operate, that will enable the practitioner to examine
prospective financial information that is appropriate for an entity operating in
that industry.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .17 </b> The practitioner should obtain knowledge of the key factors on which the entity's prospective financial information is based. (Ref: par. .A12)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Requesting a Written Assertion</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .18 </b> The practitioner should request from the responsible party a written assertion. If the responsible party refuses to provide a written assertion, the practitioner should withdraw from the engagement when withdrawal is possi-
ble under applicable law or regulation. (Ref: par. .A13)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Planning</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .19 </b> The practitioner should request from the responsible party a written assertion. If the responsible party refuses to provide a written assertion, the practitioner should withdraw from the engagement when withdrawal is possi-

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examination Procedures</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .20 </b> The examination procedures should be based on the practitioner's consideration of the following:
<ol type="a">
	<li>he nature and materiality of the information to the prospective
financial information taken as a whole</li>
	<li>he likelihood of material misstatements</li>
	<li>Knowledge obtained during current and previous engagements</li>
	<li>The responsible party's competence with respect to prospective
financial information</li>
	<li>The extent to which the prospective financial information is af-
fected by the responsible party's judgment, for example, its judg-
ment in selecting the significant assumptions used to prepare the
prospective financial information</li>
	<li>he support for the responsible party's assumptions</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .21 </b> The practitioner should evaluate whether the responsible party has a
reasonably objective basis for the forecast and should consider whether suffi-
ciently objective assumptions can be developed for each key factor. (Ref: par.
.A15)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .22 </b> The practitioner should perform those procedures the practitioner con-
siders necessary in the circumstances to report on whether the assumptions
underlying the forecast are suitably supported and provide a reasonable ba-
sis for the forecast, or whether the assumptions underlying the projection are
suitably supported and provide a reasonable basis for the projection, given the
hypothetical assumptions. (Ref: par. .A16–.A17)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .23 </b> The practitioner should evaluate the support for the significant as-
sumptions individually and in the aggregate. Assumptions are suitably sup-
ported if the preponderance of the information supports each significant as-
sumption. In an examination of a projection, the practitioner need not obtain
support for the hypothetical assumptions, although the practitioner should
evaluate whether they are consistent with the purpose of the presentation. (Ref:
par. .A18–.A20)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .24 </b> In an evaluation of whether the assumptions provide a reasonable ba-
sis for the forecast, the practitioner should evaluate the assumptions in the
aggregate. If certain assumptions do not have a material effect on the pre-
sentation, they may not have to be individually evaluated. Nonetheless, the
practitioner should evaluate the aggregate effect of individually insignificant
assumptions in making the practitioner's overall evaluation.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .25 </b> The practitioner should evaluate the assumptions related to an expired
portion of the prospective period. (Ref: par. .A21–.A23)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .26 </b> In evaluating the preparation and presentation of the prospective fi-
nancial information, the practitioner should perform procedures to obtain rea-
sonable assurance about whether the
<ol type="a">
	<li>resentation reflects the identified assumptions,</li>
	<li>omputations made to translate the assumptions into prospective
amounts are mathematically accurate,</li>
	<li>ssumptions are internally consistent,</li>
	<li>ccounting principles used in the forecast or projection are appro-
priate, (Ref: par. .A24)</li>
	<li>rospective financial information is presented in accordance with
the AICPA presentation guidelines, and</li>
	<li>ssumptions have been adequately disclosed in accordance with
the AICPA presentation guidelines.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .27 </b> The practitioner should conclude whether the prospective financial in-
formation, including related disclosures, should be revised because of any of the
following: (Ref: par. .A25)
<ol type="a">
	<li>Mathematical errors</li>
	<li>Unreasonable or internally inconsistent assumptions</li>
	<li>nappropriate or incomplete presentation</li>
	<li>nadequate disclosure</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written Representations in an Examination Engagement</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .28 </b> In an examination of a forecast, in addition to the written representations from the responsible party required by section 205, the practitioner should request from the responsible party written representations that
<ol type="a">
	<li>the forecast presents the expected financial position, results of op-
erations, and cash flows for the forecast period and that the fore-
cast reflects the responsible party's judgment, based on present
circumstances, of the expected conditions and its expected course
of action;</li>
	<li>the assumptions on which the forecast is based are reasonable
and suitably supported; and</li>
	<li>if the forecast contains a range, the item or items subject to the
assumptions are reasonably expected to fall within the range and
that the range was not selected in a biased or misleading manner.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .29 </b> In an examination of a projection, in addition to the written representa-
tions from the responsible party required by section 205, the practitioner should
request from the responsible party written representations that
<ol type="a">
	<li>identify the hypothetical assumptions;</li>
	<li>dentify which of the hypothetical assumptions, if any, are improb-
able;</li>
	<li>escribe the limitations of the usefulness of the presentation;</li>
	<li>he projection presents the expected financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows for the projection period given the hy-
pothetical assumptions, and that the projection reflects the re-
sponsible party's judgment, based on present circumstances, of
expected conditions and its expected course of action given the
occurrence of the hypothetical events;</li>
<li>he assumptions other than the hypothetical assumptions are
reasonable, given the hypothetical assumptions, and are suitably
supported; and</li>
<li>f the projection contains a range, given the hypothetical assump-
tions, the item or items subject to the assumption are reasonably
expected to actually fall within the range and that the range was
not selected in a biased or misleading manner.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .30 </b> In an examination of prospective financial information, the written
representation required by section 205 regarding whether the subject matter
is in accordance with (or based on) the criteria should indicate that the forecast
(or projection) is presented in accordance with (or based on) the guidelines for
the presentation of a financial forecast (or financial projection) established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.6 (Ref: par. .A26)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .31 </b> In an examination of prospective financial information, the practi-
tioner should request from the responsible party the written representations
required by section 205 and paragraphs .28 or .29 of this section, as applicable,
even if the engaging party is not the responsible party.7 The alternative to ob-
taining the required written representations provided for in section 205 is not
permitted in an engagement to examine prospective financial information.
8 The responsible party's refusal to furnish the written representations required by
section 205 and paragraphs .28 or .29 of this section, as applicable, constitutes a
limitation on the scope of the engagement sufficient to preclude an unmodified
opinion and may be sufficient to cause the practitioner to withdraw from the
examination engagement, when withdrawal is possible under applicable laws
and regulations.

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Content of the Practitioner’s Examination Report</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .32 </b> The practitioner's examination report on prospective financial information should include the following, unless the ractitioner is disclaiming an opinion, in which case, items .32 f , and .32 g
should be omitted: (Ref: par. .A27–.A30)
<ol type="a">
<li>A title that includes the word

spects.</li>
	<li>he practitioner believes the evidence obtained is sufficient

</ol>
<li>A description of the nature of an examination engagement.</li>
<li>he practitioner's opinion about whether the forecast (or projec-

</ol>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .33 </b> When a practitioner examines a projection, the practitioner's opinion
regarding the assumptions should be conditioned on the hypothetical assump-
tions, that is, the practitioner should express an opinion on whether the as-
sumptions provide a reasonable basis for the projection, given the hypothetical
assumptions. In addition to the required elements for a practitioner's report on
an examination of a forecast, a report on an examination of a projection should
include (Ref: par. .A27 and .A31–.A32)
<ol type="a">
	<li>n identification of the hypothetical assumptions</li>
	<li>a description of the special purpose for which the projection was
prepared, and</li>

be, used by anyone other than the specified parties.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>When the engagement is also performed in accordance with

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .34 </b> When the prospective financial information contains a range, the prac-
titioner's report should also include a separate paragraph that states that the
responsible party has elected to portray the expected results of one or more
assumptions as a range. (Ref: par. .A27 and .A33)</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modified Opinions</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .35 </b> The following are circumstances that require the practitioner to modify
the opinion and the type of modified opinion the practitioner should express in
each circumstance: (Ref: par. .A34–.A38)
<ol type="a">
	<li>f, in the practitioner's judgment, the prospective financial infor-
mation materially departs from AICPA presentation guidelines,
the practitioner should express a qualified or adverse opinion.
(Ref: par. .A35–.A36)</li>
	<li>If the prospective financial information fails to disclose assump-
tions that, in the practitioner's professional judgment, are sig-
nificant, or misapplies the accounting principles, the practitioner
should express an adverse opinion. (Ref: par. .A37)</li>
	<li>f the practitioner believes that one or more significant assump-
tions are not suitably supported or do not provide a reasonable
basis for the forecast, or for the projection given the hypothetical
assumptions, the practitioner should express an adverse opinion.
(Ref: par. .A37)</li>
	<li>f the practitioner is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate ev-
idence, the practitioner should disclaim an opinion and describe
the scope limitation in the practitioner's report. (Ref: par. .A38)</li>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Partial Presentations</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .36 </b> When examining a partial presentation, the practitioner should give
appropriate consideration to whether key factors affecting elements, accounts,
or items that are interrelated with those in the partial presentation have been
considered, including key factors that may not necessarily be obvious to the
user of a partial presentation (for example, production capacity relative to a
sales forecast), and whether all significant assumptions have been disclosed.
(Ref: par. .A39–.A40 and .A29)</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .37 </b> Because partial presentations are generally appropriate only for lim-

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objectives of an Examination Engagement (Ref: par. .07 a )</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A1 </b>The practitioner's objective in an examination of prospective financial
information is to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to reduce attestation
risk to a level that is, in the practitioner's professional judgment, acceptably
low to express an opinion about whether the prospective financial informa-
tion is presented in accordance with AICPA presentation guidelines and the
assumptions are suitably supported and provide either a reasonable basis for
the responsible party's forecast or a reasonable basis for the responsible party's
projection, given the hypothetical assumptions. The practitioner's opinion does
not address whether the prospective results can be achieved because events
and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and achievement of the
prospective results is dependent on the actions, plans, and assumptions of the
responsible party</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A2 </b>The concept of suitably supported is discussed in paragraphs .23 and .A18–.A20.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definitions</b></p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Entity (Ref: par. .09)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A3 </b>The term entity is used elsewhere in the attestation standards. How- ever, the definition of the term entity in paragraph .09 is applicable only to this section.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Financial Forecast (Ref: par. .09–.10)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A4 </b>As indicated in chapter 4, "Types of Prospective Financial Information
and Their Uses," of the guide, prospective financial statements are for either
general use or limited use.
General use of prospective financial statements
refers
to the use of the statements by persons with whom the responsible party is not
negotiating directly—for example, in an offering statement of an entity's debt
or equity interests. Because recipients of prospective financial statements dis-
tributed for general use are unable to ask the responsible party directly about
the presentation, the presentation most useful to them is one that portrays, to
the best of the responsible party's knowledge and belief, the expected results.
Thus, only a financial forecast is appropriate for general use.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Financial Projection (Ref: par. .09– .10)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A5 </b>Limited use of prospective financial statements refers to the use of prospective financial statements by the responsible party alone or by the responsible party and third parties with whom the responsible party is negotiating directly. Examples include use in negotiations for a bank loan, submission to a regulatory agency, and use solely within the entity. Third-party recipients of prospective financial statements intended for limited use can ask questions of the responsible party and negotiate terms directly with it. Any type of prospective financial statements that would be useful in the circumstances would nor-
mally be appropriate for limited use. Thus, the presentation may be a financial
forecast or a financial projection.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A6 </b>Generally, as the number or significance of the hypothetical assump-
tions increases, the less likely that it is appropriate for the responsible party to
present a financial projection.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Partial Presentation (Ref: par. .09)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A7 </b>Chapter 23, "Partial Presentations of Prospective Financial Information," of the guide establishes a limitation on the use of partial presentations.Chapter 23 of the guide states, in part</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A8 </b>Chapter 8 of the guide contains the guidelines for the presentation and disclosure of prospective financial information.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prospective Financial Statements (Ref: par. .09)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A9 </b>Prospective financial statements may take the form of complete financial statements or may be summarized or condensed, as described in chapter 8 of the guide. Presentations that exclude one or more relevant elements described in that section are defined as partial presentations
.Forthepurposesof this section, the term forecast used alone means forecasted information, which can be either a full presentation (a financial forecast) or a partial presentation. The term projection can refer to either a financial projection or a partial
presentation of projected information.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A10 </b>The objective of pro forma financial information is to show what the
significant effects on the historical financial statements might have been had
a consummated or proposed transaction or event occurred at an earlier date.
Although the transaction in question might be prospective, this section does
not apply to such presentations because they are essentially historical finan-
cial statements and do not purport to be prospective financial statements. See
section 310,
Reporting on Pro Forma Financial Information
.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preconditions for an Examination Engagement (Ref: par. .10)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A11 </b>Paragraph .10 indicates that it is not appropriate for a practitioner to
agree to the use of the practitioner's name in conjunction with a financial pro-
jection that the practitioner believes will be distributed to those who will not be
negotiating directly with the responsible party. An example of such a situation
is the inclusion of a financial projection in an offering statement of an entity's
debt or equity interests, unless the projection is used to supplement a financial
forecast for the period covered by the forecast (that is, the financial projection
would be presented in the same document as the financial forecast and the pe-
riod covered by the projection would not begin before, or extend beyond, the
period covered by the forecast).</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A12 </b>In obtaining knowledge of the entity's business, accounting policies,
and the key factors upon which its future financial results appear to depend,
the practitioner may focus on areas such as the following:
<ul>
	<li>The availability and cost of resources needed to operate, for exam-
ple, raw materials, labor, short-term and long-term financing, and
plant and equipment.</li>
	<li>The nature and condition of markets in which the entity sells its
goods or services, including final consumer markets if the entity
sells to intermediate markets</li>
	<li>Factors specific to the industry, including competitive conditions,
sensitivity to economic conditions, accounting policies, specific reg-
ulatory requirements, and technology</li>
	<li>Patterns of past performance for the entity or comparable entities,
including trends in revenue and costs, turnover of assets, uses and
capacities of physical facilities, and management policies</li>

<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Planning (Ref: par. .19)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A14 </b>Factors that may be considered by the practitioner in planning the examination of prospective financial information include the following:.
<ul>
	<li>The financial reporting framework to be used and the type of pre-
sentation</li>
	<li>Preliminary judgments about materiality levels</li>
	<li>Items within the prospective financial information that are sub-
ject to risk of material misstatement</li>
	<li>Conditions that may require extension or modification of the prac-
titioner's examination procedure</li>
	<li>Knowledge of the entity's business and its industry</li>

cial information</li>

formation</li>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A15 </b>Chapter 7 of the guide indicates that a reasonably objective basis for
a forecast cannot exist if the premise on which the assumptions are based is
too subjective. A forecast has to be based on a realistic premise, which has to be
supportable. In contrast, the basic premise for a projection does not have to be
supportable, although the hypothetical assumptions should be consistent with
the purpose of the presentation. Accordingly, in a projection, the responsible
party need not have a reasonably objective basis for the hypothetical assump-
tions.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A16 </b>Forecast
. The practitioner can form an opinion that the assumptions
provide a reasonable basis for the financial forecast if the responsible party
represents that the presentation reflects, to the best of its knowledge and belief,
its estimate of expected financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
for the prospective period, and the practitioner concludes that, based on the
practitioner's examination, (a) the responsible party has explicitly identified
all key factors expected to materially affect the operations of the entity during the prospective period and has developed appropriate assumptions with respect
to such factors, and (b
) the assumptions are suitably supported.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A17 </b>Projection.
The practitioner can form an opinion that the assump-
tions provide a reasonable basis for the financial projection given the hypothet-
ical assumptions if the responsible party represents that the presentation re-
flects, to the best of its knowledge and belief, expected financial position, results
of operations, and cash flows for the prospective period given the hypothetical
assumptions, and the practitioner concludes, based on the practitioner's exam-
ination, that
<ol type="a">
	<li>he responsible party has explicitly identified all key factors that
would materially affect the operations of the entity during the
prospective period if the hypothetical assumptions were to mate-
rialize and has developed appropriate assumptions with respect
to such factors, and</li>
<li>the other assumptions are suitably supported given the hypothet-
ical assumptions. However, as the number and significance of the
hypothetical assumptions increase, the practitioner may not be
able to be satisfied about the presentation as a whole by obtain-
ing support for the remaining assumptions.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A18 </b>A preponderance of information exists for an assumption if the weight of available information supports that assumption. Furthermore, because of the judgments involved in developing assumptions, different people may arrive at somewhat different, but equally reasonable, assumptions based
on the same information.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A19 </b>In evaluating support for assumptions other than hypothetical as-
sumptions in a projection, the practitioner can conclude that they are suit-
ably supported if the preponderance of information supports each significant
assumption given the hypothetical assumptions.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A20 </b>Appropriate considerations for forecasts and projections include
whether
<ol type="a">
	<li>sufficient pertinent sources of information about the assumptions
have been considered. Examples of external sources the prac-
titioner might consider are government publications, industry
publications, economic forecasts, existing or proposed legislation,
and reports of changing technology. Examples of internal sources
are budgets, labor agreements, patents, royalty agreements and
records, sales backlog records, debt agreements, and actions of the
board of directors involving entity plans.</li>
	<li>he assumptions are consistent with the sources from which they
are derived.</li>
	<li>the assumptions are consistent with each other.</li>
	<li>the historical financial information and other data used in devel-
oping the assumptions are sufficiently reliable for that purpose.
Reliability can be assessed by inquiry and analytical or other pro-
cedures, some of which may have been completed in past audits
or reviews of the historical financial statements.</li>
	<li>he historical financial information and other data used in devel-
oping the assumptions are comparable over the periods specified
or whether the effects of any lack of comparability were consid-
ered in developing the assumptions.</li>
	<li>he logical arguments or theory, considered with the data support-
ing the assumptions, are reasonable.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A21 </b>The procedures the practitioner performs to evaluate these assumptions depends on
<ul>
	<li>the significance of the period,</li>
	<li>whether financial statements have been prepared for the expired
period, and</li>
	<li>whether the forecast or projection incorporates the historical re-
sults.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A22 </b>The practitioner may obtain evidence regarding the actual results by applying audit or review procedures to the historical results.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A23 </b>At some point the historical results become such a large portion of
the prospective results that the practitioner might consider it inappropriate to
examine the prospective financial information.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A24 </b>Under the AICPA presentation guidelines, the accounting principles
used in a financial projection need not be those expected to be used in the histor-
ical financial statements for the prospective period if use of a different principle
is consistent with the purpose of the presentation.</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A25 </b>The practitioner's consideration of materiality is discussed in section
205.
10
Materiality is a concept that is judged in light of the expected range of
reasonableness of the information; therefore, users would not expect prospec-
tive financial information (information about events that have not yet occurred)
to be as precise as historical information.</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Written Representations in an Examination Engagement (Ref: par. .30)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A26 </b>Section 205 requires the practitioner to request written representations from the responsible party, including a representation that it has disclosed to the practitioner all known matters contradicting the subject matter.11 Because no one can know the future, "known matters," in the context of prospective financial information, refers to what the responsible party expects. The required disclosure in the written representations relates to assumptions that are not consistent with the responsible party's expectations, or in the case of
a projection, not consistent with the responsible party's expectations given the
occurrence of the hypothetical assumptions.</p>

</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A30 </b>When the practitioner's examination of prospective financial infor-

or business acquisition study, the practitioner may expand the practitioner's
report on the examination of the prospective financial information to describe
the entire engagement. Chapter 17, "The Practitioner's Examination Report,"

</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A33 </b>The following is an example of a separate paragraph to be added to
the practitioner's report when the practitioner examines prospective financial
statements, in this case, a forecast that contains a range:
</p>
<p><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modified Opinions (Ref: par. .35)</b></p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A34 </b>Because of the nature, sensitivity, and interrelationship of prospec-
tive financial information, a user of a practitioner's report may find it difficult to
interpret a practitioner's opinion that is qualified because of a misapplication
of accounting principles, the failure to disclose a significant assumption, the
unreasonableness of the underlying assumptions, an assumption that is not
suitably supported, or a scope limitation. Using language such as "except for . .
." in the practitioner's opinion about these items may result in misunderstand-
ing by users of the report. For that reason, when a misapplication of accounting
principles, a failure to disclose a significant assumption, an unreasonable as-
sumption, an assumption that is not suitably supported, or a limitation on the
scope of the practitioner's examination has led the practitioner to conclude that
the practitioner cannot express an unmodified opinion, paragraph .35 identifies
the type of modified opinion to be expressed.
13</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A35 </b>A qualified opinion may result from the failure to disclose matters (other than the significant assumptions) required by AICPA presentation guidelines, for example, the failure to disclose significant accounting policies, which is required by chapter 8 of the guide. (As indicated in paragraph .35 b, the failure to disclose significant assumptions would result in an adverse opinion.)
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A36 </b>Section 205 indicates that a qualified opinion is expressed as being "except for the effects of the matter to which the qualification relates.15 Section 205 also requires that the practitioner's opinion be separated from any paragraphs emphasizing matters related to the subject matter or any other reporting responsibilities. 16 Accordingly, the opinion paragraph would refer to a
separate paragraph that describes the matter giving rise to the qualification.
The following is an illustration of the separate paragraph that describes the
matter giving rise to the qualification and the opinion paragraph when a finan-
cial forecast contains a departure from AICPA presentation guidelines:
<p>The forecast does not disclose significant accounting policies. Disclosure of such
policies is required by guidelines for the presentation of a forecast established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.</p>
<p>In our opinion, except for the omission of the disclosures related to significant
accounting policies as discussed in the preceding paragraph, the accompany-
ing forecast is presented in accordance with the guidelines for the presentation
of a forecast established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accoun-
tants, and the underlying assumptions are suitably supported and provide a
reasonable basis for management's forecast.</p>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A37 </b>In an adverse opinion, the practitioner's opinion states that the pre-
sentation is not in accordance with the AICPA presentation guidelines and,
when applicable, also states that in the practitioner's opinion, the assump-
tions are not suitably supported and do not provide a reasonable basis for the
prospective financial statements. The following are illustrative paragraphs for
use when the practitioner expresses an adverse opinion because the financial
forecast contains a significant assumption that is unreasonable:
<p>As discussed under the caption "Sales" in the summary of significant forecast
assumptions, the forecasted sales include, among other things, revenue from
the Company's federal defense contracts continuing at the current level. The
Company's present federal defense contracts will expire in March 20XX. No
new contracts have been signed, and no negotiations are underway for new
federal defense contracts. Furthermore, the federal government has entered
into contracts with another company to supply the items being manufactured
under the Company's present contracts.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the accompanying forecast is not presented in accordance with
the guidelines for the presentation of a forecast established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants because management's assumptions,
as discussed in the preceding paragraph, are not suitably supported and do not
provide a reasonable basis for management's forecast</p>
 </p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A38 </b>In a disclaimer of opinion, the paragraph of the practitioner's report
that describes the matters giving rise to the opinion modification describes the
respects in which the examination did not comply with attestation standards
applicable to an examination engagement. The practitioner states that because
of the respects in which the examination did not comply with such standards,
the scope of the examination was not sufficient to enable the practitioner to
express, and the practitioner does not express, an opinion on the presentation
of or the assumptions underlying the forecast or projection. The following is
an illustrative report on an examination of prospective financial statements, in this case, a financial forecast, for which a significant assumption could not be
evaluated.
<p>We were engaged to examine the accompanying forecast of XYZ Company,
which comprises the forecasted balance sheet as of December 31, 20XX, and the
related forecasted statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
the year then ending. XYZ Company's management is responsible for preparing
and presenting the forecast in accordance with the guidelines for the presen-
tation of a forecast established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants.</p>
<p>As discussed under the caption, "Income From Investee" in the summary of
significant forecast assumptions, the forecast includes income from an equity
investee constituting 23 percent of forecasted net income, which is manage-
ment's estimate of the Company's share of the investee's income to be accrued
for 20XX. The investee has not prepared a forecast for the year ending Decem-
ber 31, 20XX, and we were, therefore, unable to obtain suitable support for this
assumption.</p>
<p>Because, as described in the preceding paragraph, we are unable to evaluate
management's assumption regarding income from an equity investee and other
assumptions that depend thereon, the scope of our work was not sufficient to
express, and we do not express, an opinion with respect to the presentation of
or the assumptions underlying the accompanying forecast</p>
<p>We have no responsibility to update this report for events and circumstances
occurring after the date of this report.</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A40 </b>The practitioner's procedures on a partial presentation may be af-
fected by the nature of the information presented. Many elements of prospec-
tive financial statements are interrelated. The nature and extent of the proce-
dures performed in an examination of some partial presentations may need to
be similar to the procedures performed in an examination of a full presentation
of prospective financial statements. For example, the scope of a practitioner's
procedures when the practitioner examines forecasted results of operations (a
partial presentation) would likely be similar to that of procedures used for the
examination of prospective financial statements because the practitioner would
most likely need to consider the interrelationships of all accounts in the exam-
ination of results of operations.</p>

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the forecast based
on our examination.</p>
<p>Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards es-

standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain rea-
sonable assurance about whether the forecast is presented in accordance with
the guidelines for the presentation of a forecast established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, in all material respects. An examina-
tion involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the forecast. The
nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment,
including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the forecast,
whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained is suf-
ficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the accompanying forecast is presented, in all material respects,
in accordance with the guidelines for the presentation of a forecast established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the underlying
assumptions are suitably supported and provide a reasonable basis for man-
agement's forecast.</p>
<p>There will usually be differences between the forecasted and actual results be-
cause events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and those
differences may be material. We have no responsibility to update this report for
events and circumstances occurring after the date of this report</p>

<p>Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards es-
tablished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reason-
able assurance about whether the projection is presented in accordance with
the guidelines for the presentation of a projection established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, in all material respects. An exami-
nation involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the projection.
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judg-
ment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the pro-
jection, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence we obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<p>In our opinion, [
describe the hypothetical assumption(s), for example, assuming
the granting of the requested loan for the purpose of expanding XYZ Company's
plant as described in the summary of significant assumptions
] the projection
referred to above is presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the
guidelines for the presentation of a projection established by the American In-
stitute of Certified Public Accountants, and the underlying assumptions are
suitably supported and provide a reasonable basis for management's projec-
tion given the hypothetical assumption(s).</p>
<p>Even if [

and the plant is expanded,

jected and actual results because events and circumstances frequently do not
occur as expected, and those differences may be material. We have no respon-
