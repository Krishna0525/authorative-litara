The guidance in this Section relates to how a reporting entity determines the functional currency of a foreign entity (including of a foreign entity in a highly inflationary economy), remeasures the books of record (if necessary), and characterizes transaction gains and losses. The guidance is organized as follows:
<ol>
	<li>a. The functional currency</li>
	<li>b. The functional currency in highly inflationary economies</li>
	<li>c. Remeasurement of books of record into the functional currency</li>
	<li>d. Subparagraph superseded by Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-01.</li>
</ol>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; The Functional Currency</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-2 </b>The assets, liabilities, and operations of a foreign entity shall be measured using the functional currency of that entity. An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates; normally, that is the currency of the environment in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Identifying a Foreign Entity's Functional Currency</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-3 </b>It is neither possible nor desirable to provide unequivocal criteria to identify the functional currency of foreign entities under all possible facts and circumstances and still fulfill the objectives of foreign currency translation. Arbitrary rules that might dictate the identification of the functional currency in each case would accomplish a degree of superficial uniformity but, in the process, might diminish the relevance and reliability of the resulting information.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4 </b>Multinational reporting entities may consist of entities operating in a number of economic environments and dealing in a number of foreign currencies. All foreign operations are not alike. To fulfill the objectives in paragraph 830-10-10-2, it is necessary to recognize at least two broad classes of foreign operations: 
<ol>
	<li>
		a. In the first class are foreign operations that are relatively self-contained and integrated within a particular country or economic environment. The day-to-day operations are not dependent on the economic environment of the parent's functional currency; the foreign operation primarily generates and expends foreign currency. The foreign currency net cash flows that it generates may be reinvested or converted and distributed to the parent. For this class, the foreign currency is the functional currency.
	</li>
	<li>
		b. In the second class are foreign operations that are primarily a direct and integral component or extension of the parent entity's operations. Significant assets may be acquired from the parent entity or otherwise by expending dollars and, similarly, the sale of assets may generate dollars that are available to the parent. Financing is primarily by the parent or otherwise from dollar sources. In other words, the day-to-day operations are dependent on the economic environment of the parent's currency, and the changes in the foreign entity's individual assets and liabilities impact directly on the cash flows of the parent entity in the parent's currency. For this class, the dollar is the functional currency.
	</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-5 </b>An entity might have more than one distinct and separable operation, such as a division or branch, in which case each operation may be considered a separate entity. If those operations are conducted in different economic environments, they might have different functional currencies.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-6 </b>The functional currency of an entity is, in principle, a matter of fact. In some cases, the facts will clearly identify the functional currency; in other cases they will not. For example, if a foreign entity conducts significant amounts of business in two or more currencies, the functional currency might not be clearly identifiable. In those instances, the economic facts and circumstances pertaining to a particular foreign operation shall be assessed in relation to the stated objectives for foreign currency translation (see paragraphs 830-10-10-1 through 10-2). Management's judgment will be required to determine the functional currency in which financial results and relationships are measured with the greatest degree of relevance and reliability.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Changes in the Functional Currency</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-7 </b>Once the functional currency for a foreign entity is determined, that determination shall be used consistently unless significant changes in economic facts and circumstances indicate clearly that the functional currency has changed. Previously issued financial statements shall not be restated for any change in the functional currency.
</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-8 </b>See paragraph 250-10-45-1 for guidance on adoption or modification of an accounting principle necessitated by transactions or events that are clearly different in substance from those previously occurring. Paragraphs 830-10-45-15 through 45-16 discuss changes related to highly inflationary economies.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;&gt; FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY CHANGES FROM REPORTING CURRENCY TO FOREIGN CURRENCY</b>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-9 </b>If the functional currency changes from the reporting currency to a foreign currency, the adjustment attributable to current-rate translation of nonmonetary assets as of the date of the change shall be reported in other comprehensive income.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;&gt; FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY CHANGES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TO REPORTING CURRENCY</b>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-10 </b>If the functional currency changes from a foreign currency to the reporting currency, translation adjustments for prior periods shall not be removed from equity and the translated amounts for nonmonetary assets at the end of the prior period become the accounting basis for those assets in the period of the change and subsequent periods. This guidance shall be used also to account for a change in functional currency from the foreign currency to the reporting currency when an economy becomes highly inflationary.
