<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A2</b>For audits of governmental entities, the objectives of a financial statement
audit are often broader than forming and expressing an opinion on the
financial statements. Law, regulation, and Government Auditing Standards require
that the auditor satisfy additional objectives. These additional objectives
include audit and reporting responsibilities, for example, relating to reporting
instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or reporting
material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in internal control noted during
the audit. Such reporting on compliance and internal control is an integral
part of a Government Auditing Standards audit.</div>

<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A4</b>For most state or local governmental entities, the applicable financial
reporting framework is based on multiple reporting units and, therefore, requires
the presentation of financial statements for its activities in various reporting
units. Consequently, a reporting unit, or aggregation of reporting units,
of the governmental entity represents an opinion unit to the auditor. In the
context of this section, the auditor is responsible for forming an opinion on the
financial statements for each opinion unit within a governmental entity</div>

disclosures in the financial statements.</div>
<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A6</b>Section 260, The Auditor's Communication With Those Charged With
Governance, contains a discussion of the qualitative aspects of accounting
practices.13 In considering the qualitative aspects of the entity's accounting
practices, the auditor may become aware of possible bias in management's
judgments. The auditor may conclude that the cumulative effect of a lack of
neutrality, together with the effect of uncorrected misstatements, causes the
financial statements as a whole to be materially misstated. Indicators of a lack
of neutrality that may affect the auditor's evaluation of whether the financial
statements as a whole are materially misstated include the following:
<ul>
	<li>The selective correction of misstatements brought to management's
attention during the audit (for example, correcting misstatements
with the effect of increasing reported earnings but not correcting misstatements that have the effect of decreasing
reported earnings)</li>
<li>Possible management bias in the making of accounting estimates</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A7</b>Section 540, Auditing Accounting Estimates, Including Fair Value Accounting
Estimates, and Related Disclosures, addresses possible management
bias in making accounting estimates. Indicators of possible management bias,
themselves, do not constitute misstatements for purposes of drawing conclusions
on the reasonableness of individual accounting estimates. They may, however,
affect the auditor's evaluation of whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Disclosure of the Effect of Material Transactions and Events on the
Information Conveyed in the Financial Statements (Ref: par. .16e)</i>
</b></div>
<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A8</b>It is common for financial statements prepared in accordance with a
general purpose framework to present an entity's financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows. In such circumstances, paragraph .16e requires the
auditor to evaluate whether the financial statements provide adequate disclosures
to enable the intended users to understand the effect of material transactions
and events on the entity's financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.</div>

<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A9</b>As described in section 200, Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor
and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance With Generally Accepted Auditing
Standards, a financial reporting framework is a set of criteria used to determine
measurement, recognition, presentation, and disclosure of all material
items appearing in the financial statements. The auditor's professional judgment
concerning the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements is
applied within the context of the financial reporting framework. Without that
framework, the auditor would have no consistent standard for evaluating the
presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in financial
statements.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Description of the Applicable Financial Reporting Framework (Ref: par. .18)</i>
</b></div>
<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A10</b>As explained in section 200, the preparation and fair presentation of
the financial statements by management and, when appropriate, those charged
with governance requires the inclusion of an adequate description of the applicable
financial reporting framework in the financial statements.14 That description
is important because it advises users of the financial statements of
the framework on which the financial statements are based.</div>
<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A11</b>A description that the financial statements are prepared in accordance
with a particular applicable financial reporting framework is appropriate
only if the financial statements comply with all the requirements of that
framework that are effective during the period covered by the financial statements.</div>
<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A12</b>A description of the applicable financial reporting framework that
contains imprecise qualifying or limiting language (for example, "the financial statements are in substantial compliance with International Financial Reporting
Standards") is not an adequate description of that framework because it
may mislead users of the financial statements.</div>
<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A13</b>Financial statements that are prepared in accordance with one financial
reporting framework and that contain a note or supplementary statement
reconciling the results to those that would be shown under another framework
are not prepared in accordance with that other framework. This is because the
financial statements do not include all the information in the manner required
by that other framework. The financial statements may, however, be prepared
in accordance with one applicable financial reporting framework and, in addition,
describe in the notes to the financial statements the extent to which the
financial statements comply with another framework. Such information may
not be required by the applicable financial reporting framework but may be
presented as part of the basic financial statements. As discussed in paragraph
.58, such information is considered an integral part of the financial statements
if it cannot be clearly differentiated and, accordingly, is covered by the auditor's
opinion.</div>

<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A14</b>There may be cases when the financial statements, although prepared
in accordance with the requirements of a fair presentation framework,
do not achieve fair presentation. When this is the case, it may be possible for
management to include additional disclosures in the financial statements beyond
those specifically required by the framework or, in unusual circumstances,
to depart from a requirement in the framework in order to achieve fair presentation
of the financial statements, which would be extremely rare.</div>
<div>
	<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A15</b>The "Accounting Principles Rule" (ET sec. 1.320.001) of the AICPA
Code of Professional Conduct states the following:
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A member shall not (1) express an opinion or state affirmatively that the financial
statements or other financial data of any entity are presented in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles or (2) state that he or she is not
aware of any material modifications that should be made to such statements or
data in order for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles, if such statements or data contain any departure from an accounting
principle promulgated by bodies designated by Council to establish such principles
that has a material effect on the statements or data taken as a whole.
If, however, the statements or data contain such a departure and the member
can demonstrate that due to unusual circumstances the financial statements
or data would otherwise have been misleading, the member can comply with
the rule by describing the departure, its approximate effects, if practicable, and
the reasons why compliance with the principle would result in a misleading
statement.</p>

is prepared. The report may be addressed to the entity whose financial
statements are being audited or to those charged with governance. A report
on the financial statements of an unincorporated entity may be addressed as
circumstances dictate (for example, to the partners, general partner, or proprietor).
Occasionally, an auditor may be retained to audit the financial statements
of an entity that is not a client; in such a case, the report may be addressed to
the client and not to those charged with governance of the entity whose financial
statements are being audited.</div>
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introductory Paragraph (Ref: par. .25)</i>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A20 </b>The introductory paragraph states, for example, that the auditor has
"audited the accompanying financial statements of ABC Company, which comprise
the balance sheet as of December 31, 20X1, and the related statements of
income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended,
and the related notes to the financial statements." If the financial statements
include a separate statement of changes in stockholders' equity accounts or
a separate statement of comprehensive income, paragraph .25c requires such
statements to be identified in the introductory paragraph of the report as a
statement to which the financial statements are comprised, but they need not
be reported on separately in the opinion paragraph because changes in stockholders'
equity accounts and comprehensive income are considered part of the
presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A21 </b>When the auditor is aware that the audited financial statements will
be included in a document that contains other information, such as an annual

the page numbers on which the audited financial statements are presented.
This helps users identify the financial statements to which the auditor's report
relates.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A22 </b>The auditors opinion covers the complete set of financial statements,
as defined by the applicable financial reporting framework. For example, in the
case of many general purpose frameworks, the financial statements include a
balance sheet; an income statement; a statement of changes in equity; and a
cash flow statement, including related notes. In some circumstances, additional
or different statements, schedules, or information also might be considered to
be an integral part of the financial statements. </div>

management and, when appropriate, those charged with governance on which an audit in accordance with GAAS is conducted.15 Management and, when appropriate,
those charged with governance accept responsibility for the preparation
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting
framework, including their fair presentation. Management also accepts
responsibility for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control
relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The
description of management's responsibilities in the auditor's report includes
reference to both responsibilities because it helps explain to users the premise
on which an audit is conducted.</div>
<div><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> .A25 </b>In some instances, a document containing the auditor's report may include
a separate statement by management regarding its responsibility for the
preparation of the financial statements. Any elaboration in the auditor's report
about management's responsibilities regarding the preparation of the financial
statements, or reference to a separate statement by management about such
responsibilities if one is included in a document containing the auditor's report,
may lead users to erroneously believe that the auditor is providing assurances
about representations made by management about their responsibility for financial
reporting, internal control, and other matters that might be discussed
in the management report. </div>
