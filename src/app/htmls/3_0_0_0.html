the likelihood is slight that a loan commitment will be exercised before its expiration.</p>

<!-- end p -->

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-18</b>  Net fees or costs that are required to be recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the
related loan(s) shall be recognized by the interest method except as set forth in paragraphs 310-20-35- 21 through 35-24. The objective of the
interest method is to arrive at periodic interest income ( including recognition of fees and costs) at a constant effective yield on the net
investment in the receivable ( that is, the principal amount of the receivable adjusted by unamortized fees or costs and purchase premium or
discount). The difference between the periodic interest income so determined and the stated interest on the outstanding principal amount of the
receivable is the amount of periodic amortization. See paragraphs 835-30- 35-2 through 35-5 for guidance concerning the interest method. Under the
provision of this Subtopic,the interest method shall be applied as follows when the stated interest rate is not constant throughout the term of
the loan:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">a. If the loan’s stated interest rate increase during the term of the loan (so that interest accrued under the
interest method in early periods would exceed interest at the stated rate), interest income shall not be recognized to the extent that the net
investment in the loan would increase to an amount greater than the amount at which the borrower could settle the obligation. Prepayment penalties
shall be considered in determining the amount at which the borrower could settle the obligation only to the extent that such penalties are imposed
throughout the loan term. ( See Section 310-20- 55). Accordingly, a limit is imposed on the amount of periodic amortization that can be
recognized. However that limitation does not apply to the capitalization of costs incurred (such as direct loan origination costs and purchase
premiums) that cause the investment in the loan to be in excess of the amount at which the borrower could settle the obligation. The
capitalization of costs incurred is different from increasing the net investment in a loan through accrual of interest income that is only
contingently receivable.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">b. If the loan’s stated interest rate decreases during the term of the loan, the stated periodic interest received
early in the term of the loan would exceed the periodic interest income that is calculated under the interest method. In that circumstance, the
excess shall be deferred and recognized in those future periods when the constant effective yield under the interest method exceeds the stated
interest rate. (See Section 310-20- 55)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">c. If the loan’s stated interest rate varies based on future changes in an independent factor, such as an index or
rate ( for example , the prime rate, the London Interbank Offered Rate [LIBOR] , or the U. S. Treasury bill weekly average rate), the calculation
of the constant effective yield necessary to recognize fees and costs shall be based either on the factor ( the index or rate) that is in effect
at the inception of the loan or on the factor as it changes over the life of the loan. (See Section 310-20- 55). A variable rate loan whose
initial rate differs from the rate its base factor would produce is also subject to the provisions of (a) and (b).</p>

<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-19</b>  The preceding paragraph provides that when a loan’s stated interest rate varies based on future
changes in an independent factor, the lender shall calculate a constant effective yield by using the independent factor in effect at the inception
of the loan or the factor as it changes over the life of the loan. In applying the guidance in (c) in the preceding paragraph, the lender may not
change from one alternative to the other during the life of the loan. The lender must select one of the two alternatives and apply the method

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">b. If no understanding exists, the lender’s estimate of the period of time over which the loan will remain

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-24</b>  For example, if the loan agreement provides the borrower with the option to convert a one- year

the line of credit to a term loan, the lender would recognize the unamortized net fees or costs as an adjustment of yield using the interest
