<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc56001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibilities relating to subsequent events and subsequently discovered facts in an audit of financial statements. It also addresses a predecessor auditor's responsibilities for subsequent events and subsequently discovered facts when reissuing the auditor's report on previously issued financial statements that are to be presented on a comparative basis with audited financial statements of a subsequent period.

<i>Dating the Auditor's Report on the Revised Financial Statements</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a11">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A11  </b>The auditor has two methods available for dating the auditor's report when the financial statements are revised after the original date of the auditor's report. The auditor may include an additional date limited to the revision (that is, dual-date the auditor's report for that revision) or date the auditor's report as of a later date. In the former instance, the auditor's responsibility for events occurring subsequent to the original date of the auditor's report is limited to the specific event described in the relevant note to the financial statements. In the latter instance, the auditor's responsibility for subsequent events extends to the new date of the auditor's report on the revised financial statements.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a12">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A12  </b>Generally, when the revision of the financial statements is specifically limited to the effects of the specific event described in the relevant note to the financial statements, the auditor may decide to limit the audit procedures to that revision, as provided by paragraph .13b. Even when the financial statements are revised and disclosure of the revision is made, the auditor is not precluded from extending the audit procedures referred to in paragraphs .09-.10 to the new date of the auditor's report on the revised financial statements, as provided by paragraph .13a.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a13">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A13  </b>When, in the circumstances described in paragraph .13b, the auditor includes an additional date limited to the revision (a dual date), the original date of the auditor's report on the financial statements prior to their subsequent revision by management remains unchanged because this date informs the reader about when the auditor obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence with respect to those financial statements prior to their subsequent revision. However, an additional date is included in the auditor's report to inform users that the auditor's procedures subsequent to the original date of the auditor's report were limited to the subsequent revision of the financial statements. The following is an illustration of such wording:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">(Date of auditor's report), except as to note Y, which is as of (date of completion of audit procedures limited to revision described in note Y).
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a14">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A14  </b>As discussed in paragraph .A10, section 700 requires the auditor's report to be dated no earlier than the date on which the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to base the auditor's opinion on the financial statements.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">11</sup>  When management revises the financial statements and the auditor reports on the revised financial statements, the new date (or the dual date) included in the auditor's report cannot be earlier than the date on which the auditor carried out the audit procedures necessary in the circumstances on the revision, including that the documentation has been reviewed and management has prepared and asserted that they have taken responsibility for the revised financial statements.

<i>Updated Written Representations</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a15">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A15  </b>Section 580 requires the date of the written representations to be as of the date of the auditor's report on the financial statements.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">12</sup>  If management revises the financial statements and, in accordance with paragraph .13a, the auditor dates the auditor's report on the revised financial statements as of a later date, written representations from management are required as of the later date to comply with section 580. The auditor may request management to provide a new representation letter or may agree with management on a form of written representations that update the written representations previously provided by addressing whether there are any changes to such written representations and, if so, what they are. An updated written representation letter may be in the form of the representations required by paragraph .13b when the auditor dual-dates the auditor's report for the revision.

<i>Unaudited Events</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a16">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A16  </b>To prevent the financial statements from being misleading, management may revise the financial statements by disclosing an event that arose after the original date of the auditor's report. When such event is included in a separate financial statement note that is labeled as unaudited (for example, when the event is captioned "Event (Unaudited) Subsequent to the Date of the Independent Auditor's Report"), the auditor is not required to perform any procedures on the revision, and the auditor's report carries the original date of the auditor's report.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations Specific to Governmental Entities</i>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a17">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A17  </b>In audits of governmental entities in which management does not revise the financial statements, the actions taken in accordance with paragraph .14 may also include reporting separately to the legislative or governing body, or other relevant regulatory or oversight body, on the implications of the subsequent event for the financial statements and the auditor's report and, if applicable, for the entity's internal control over financial reporting and compliance with law or regulation.

<i>Auditor's Responsibility After the Report Release Date</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a18">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A18  </b>New information may come to the auditor's attention that, had such information been known to the auditor at the date of the auditor's report, may have caused the auditor to revise the auditor's report. When such information becomes known to the auditor after the report release date, the requirements in paragraphs .15-.18 apply, even if the auditor has withdrawn or been discharged.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a19">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A19  </b>Because of the variety of conditions that might be encountered, the specific procedures or actions to be taken in a particular case may vary somewhat in light of the circumstances. For example, in determining whether the financial statements need revision, as required by paragraph .15b, the auditor may consider, in addition to the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework, whether the auditor believes there are persons currently relying or likely to rely on the financial statements who would attach importance to the subsequently discovered facts. Consideration may be given, among other things, to the issuance of audited financial statements for a subsequent period, the time elapsed since the financial statements were issued and the auditor's report released, and any legal implications.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a20">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A20  </b>Section 708, Consistency of Financial Statements, addresses the auditor's evaluation of the consistency of the financial statements, including changes to previously issued financial statements, and the effect of that evaluation on the auditor's report.

<i>Revision of Financial Statements by Management</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a21">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A21  </b>The steps taken by management to ensure that anyone in receipt of the audited financial statements is informed of the situation, including that the audited financial statements are not to be relied upon, depend on the circumstances. Management's steps may include the following:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Notification to anyone who is known to be relying or who is likely to rely on the financial statements and the auditor's report that they are not to be relied upon and that revised financial statements, together with a new auditor's report, will be issued. This may be necessary when the issuance of revised financial statements and a new auditor's report is not imminent.</li>

<li>Issuing, as soon as practicable, revised financial statements with appropriate disclosure of the matter.</li>

<li>Issuing the subsequent period's financial statements with appropriate disclosure of the matter. This may be appropriate when issuance of the subsequent period's audited financial statements is imminent.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations Specific to Governmental Entities</i>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc560a22">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A22  </b>For audits performed under Government Auditing Standards, additional requirements exist, such as those pertaining to the evaluation of the timeliness and appropriateness of management's disclosure and actions to determine and correct misstatements in previously issued financial statements, reporting on the revised financial statements, and reporting directly to appropriate officials when management does not take the necessary steps.
