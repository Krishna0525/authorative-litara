</p>
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Initial Measurement Section provides guidance on the criteria and amounts used to measure a particular item at the date of initial recognition.
</p><p>
<p class="header">General</p>
</p><p id="74030">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-1</b>  This Section provides guidance on the measurement of total income tax expense. While most of this guidance focuses on the initial measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including determining the appropriate tax rate to be used, the requirements for measuring current taxes payable or refundable are also established. This guidance also addresses the consideration and establishment of a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">valuation allowance</b> for deferred tax assets. Requirements for entities that issue separate financial statements and are part of a group that files a consolidated tax return are also established in this Section.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Basic Requirements</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-2</b>  The following basic requirements are applied to the measurement of current and deferred <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">income taxes</b> at the date of the financial statements:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. The measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the
enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax
benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-3</b>  Total income tax expense (or benefit) for the year is the sum of <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">deferred tax expense (or benefit)</b> and <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">income taxes currently payable or refundable</b>.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;&gt;  Deferred Tax Expense (or Benefit)</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-4</b>  Deferred tax expense (or benefit) is the change during the year in an entity's deferred tax liabilities and assets. For deferred tax liabilities and assets recognized in a business combination or in an <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">acquisition by a not-for-profit entity</b> during the year, it is the change since the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">acquisition date</b>. Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">830-740-45-1</u> addresses the manner of reporting the transaction gain or loss that is included in the net change in a deferred foreign tax liability or asset when the reporting currency is the functional currency.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-5</b>  Deferred taxes shall be determined separately for each tax-paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. That determination includes the following procedures:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Identify the types and amounts of existing temporary differences and the nature and amount of each type of operating loss and tax credit carryforward and the remaining length of the carryforward period.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. Measure the total <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">deferred tax liability</b> for taxable temporary differences using the applicable tax rate (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-30-8</u>).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. Measure the total <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">deferred tax asset</b> for deductible temporary differences and operating loss <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">carryforwards</b> using the applicable tax rate.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. Measure deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e. Reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance shall be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
</p>
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;&gt;  Income Taxes Payable or Refundable (Current Tax Expense [or Benefit])</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">730-6</b>  Income taxes payable or refundable (current tax expense [or benefit]) are determined under the recognition and measurement requirements for tax positions established in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-25-2</u> for recognition and in this Section for measurement.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-7</b>  A <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">tax position</b> that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Measurement of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold shall consider the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement using the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. As used in this Subtopic, the term <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">reporting date</i> refers to the date of the entity's most recent statement of financial position. For further explanation and illustration, see Examples 5 through 10 (paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-55-99 through 55-116</u>).
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Applicable Tax Rate Used to Measure Deferred Taxes</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-8</b>  Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-10-3</u> establishes that the objective is to measure a deferred tax liability or asset using the enacted tax rate(s) expected to apply to <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">taxable income</b> in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. Deferred taxes shall not be accounted for on a discounted basis.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-9</b>  Under tax law with a graduated tax rate structure, if taxable income exceeds a specified amount, all taxable income is taxed, in substance, at a single flat tax rate. That tax rate shall be used for measurement of a deferred tax liability or asset by entities for which graduated tax rates are not a significant factor. Entities for which graduated tax rates are a significant factor shall measure a deferred tax liability or asset using the average graduated tax rate applicable to the amount of estimated annual taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is estimated to be settled or realized. See Example 16 (paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-55-136</u>) for an illustration of the determination of the average graduated tax rate. Other provisions of enacted tax laws shall be considered when determining the tax rate to apply to certain types of temporary differences and carryforwards (for example, the tax law may provide for different tax rates on ordinary income and capital gains). If there is a phased-in change in tax rates, determination of the applicable tax rate requires knowledge about when deferred tax liabilities and assets will be settled and realized.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-10</b>  In the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction, the applicable tax rate is the regular tax rate, and a deferred tax asset is recognized for alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 740-10-30-5(d) through (e).
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-11</b>  The objective established in paragraph 740-10-10-3 relating to enacted tax rate(s) expected to apply is not achieved through measurement of deferred taxes using the lower alternative minimum tax rate if an entity currently is an alternative minimum tax payer and expects to always be an alternative minimum tax payer.  No one can predict whether an entity will always be an alternative minimum tax payer.  Furthermore, it would be counterintuitive if the addition of alternative minimum tax provisions to the tax law were to have the effect of reducing the amount of an entity's income tax expense for financial reporting, given that the provisions of alternative minimum tax may be either neutral or adverse but never beneficial to an entity.  It also would be counterintuitive to assume that an entity would permit its alternative minimum tax credit carryforward to expire unused at the end of the life of the entity, which would have to occur if that entity was always an alternative minimum taxpayer.  Use of the lower alternative minimum tax rate to measure an entity's deferred tax liability could result in understatement for either of the following reasons:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  It could be understated if the entity currently is an alternative minimum tax taxpayer because of temporary differences.  Temporary differences reverse and, over the entire life of the entity, cumulative income will be taxed at regular tax rates.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  It could be understated if the entity currently is an alternative minimum tax taxpayer because of preference items but does not have enough alternative minimum tax credit to carryforward to reduce its deferred tax liability from the amount of regular tax on regular tax temporary differences to the amount of tentative minimum tax on alternative minimum tax temporary differences.  In those circumstances, measurement of the deferred tax liability using alternative minimum tax rates would anticipate the tax benefit of future special deductions, such as statutory depletion, which have not yet been earned.</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-12</b>  If alternative tax systems exist in jurisdictions other than the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the applicable tax rate is determined in a manner consistent with the tax law after giving consideration to any interaction (that is, a mechanism similar to the U.S. alternative minimum tax credit) between the two systems.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt;  Effect of Anticipated Future Special Deductions and Tax Credits on Deferred Tax Rates</p>
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Anticipated Future Special Deductions</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-13</b>  As required by paragraph 740-10-25-37, the tax benefit of special deductions ordinarily is recognized no earlier than the year in which those special deductions are deductible on the tax return.  However, some portion of the future tax effects of special deductions are implicitly recognized in determining the average graduated tax rate to be used for measuring deferred taxes when graduated tax rates are a significant factor and the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.  In those circumstances, implicit recognition is unavoidable because those special deductions are one of the determinants of future taxable income and future taxable income determines the average graduated tax rate and sometimes determines the need for a valuation allowance.</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Anticipated Future Tax Credits</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-14</b>  Paragraph 740-10-25-39 notes that certain foreign jurisdictions may tax corporate income at different rates depending on whether that income is distributed to shareholders.  Paragraph 740-10-25-40 addresses recognition of future tax credits that will be realized when the previously taxed income is distributed.  Under these circumstances, the entity shall measure the tax effects of temporary differences using the undistributed rate.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-15</b>  As noted in paragraph 740-10-25-41, the accounting required in the consolidated financial statements of a parent that includes a foreign subsidiary that receives a tax credit for dividends paid may differ from the accounting required for the subsidiary.  See that paragraph for the rates required to be used to measure deferred income taxes in such consolidated financial statements.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt;  Establishment of a Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-16</b>  As established in paragraph 740-10-30-2(b), there is a basic requirement to reduce the measurement of deferred tax assets not expected to be realized.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-17</b>  All available evidence, both positive and negative, shall be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed.  Information about an entity's current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years ordinarily is readily available.  That historical information is supplemented by all currently available information about future years.  Sometimes, however, historical information may not be available (for example, start-up operations) or it may not be as relevant (for example, if there has been significant, recent change in circumstances) and special attention is required.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-18</b>  Future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income capital gain) within the carryback, carryforward period available under the tax law.  The following four possible sources of taxable income may be available under the tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards:


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Tax-planning strategies (see paragraph 740-10-30-19) that would, if necessary, be implemented to, for example:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">1.  Accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">2.  Change the character of taxable or deductible amounts from ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">3.  Switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments.</p>

</p>

</p><p>Evidence available about each of those possible sources of taxable income will vary for different tax jurisdictions and, possibly, from year to year.  To the extent evidence about one or more sources of taxable income is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary, other sources need not be considered.  Consideration of each source is required, however, to determine the amount of the valuation allowance that is recognized for deferred tax assets.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-19</b>  In some circumstances, there are actions (including elections for tax purposes) that:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Are prudent and feasible
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  An entity ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Would result in realization of deferred tax assets.
</p>
</p><p>The Subtopic refers to those actions as tax-planning strategies.  An entity shall consider tax-planning strategies in determining the amount of valuation allowance required.  Significant expenses to implement a tax-planning strategy or any significant losses that would be recognized if that strategy were implemented (net of any recognizable tax benefits associated with those expenses or losses) shall be included in the valuation allowance.  See paragraphs 740-10-55-39 through 55-48 for additional guidance.  Implementation of the tax-planning strategy shall be primarily within the control of management but need not be within the unilateral control of management.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-20</b>  When a tax-planning strategy is contemplated as a source of future taxable income to support the realizability of a deferred tax asset, the recognition and measurement requirements for tax positions in paragraphs 740-10-25-6 through 25-7; 740-10-25-13; and 740-10-30-7 shall be applied in determining the amount of available future taxable income.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-21</b>  Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years.  Other examples of negative evidence include, but are not limited to, the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  A history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Losses expected in early future years (by a presently profitable entity)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  A carryback, carryforward period that is so brief it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year or the entity operates in a traditionally cyclical business.
</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-22</b>  Examples (not prerequisites) of positive evidence that might support a conclusion that a  valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence include, but are not limited to, the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Existing contracts or firm sales backlog that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  An excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of the entity's net assets in an amount sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  A strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount (tax loss carryforward or deductible temporary difference) coupled with evidence indicating that the loss (for example, an unusual, infrequent, or extraordinary item) is an aberration rather than a continuing condition.
</p>

</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-23</b>  An entity shall use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.  The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence shall be commensurate with  the extent to which it can be objectively verified.  The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset.  A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-24</b>  Future realization of a tax benefit sometimes will be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset, and the dividing line between the two portions may be unclear.  In those circumstances, application of judgment based on a careful assessment of all available evidence is required to determine the portion of a deferred tax asset for which it is more likely than not a tax benefit will not be realized.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-25</b>  See paragraphs 740-10-55-34 through 55-38 for additional guidance related to carrybacks and carryforwards.
