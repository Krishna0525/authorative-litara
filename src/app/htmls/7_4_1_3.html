<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note: </b>The Subsequent Measurement Section provides guidance on an entity's subsequent measurement and subsequent recognition of an item.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-35-1   </b>Section 740-10-30 addresses initial measurement of current and deferred income tax accounts. This Section addresses the accounting for certain changes subsequent to initial measurement. The guidance in this Section is incremental to the guidance for initial measurement.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; New Information Affecting Measurement of Tax Positions</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-35-2   </b>Subsequent measurement of a tax position meeting the recognition requirements of paragraph 740-10-25-6 shall be based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. Paragraph 740-10-30-7 explains that the reporting date is the date of the entity's most recent statement of financial position. A tax position need not be legally extinguished and its resolution need not be certain to subsequently measure the position. Subsequent changes in judgment that lead to changes in measurement shall result from the evaluation of new information and not from a new evaluation or new interpretation by management of information that was available in a previous financial reporting period. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-35-3   </b>Paragraph 740-10-25-15 requires that a change in judgment that results in a change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period (including any related interest and penalties) shall be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs. Paragraph 740-270-35-6 addresses the different accounting required for such changes in a prior interim period within the same fiscal year. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; </b>Changes in Tax Laws or Rates </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-35-4   </b>Deferred tax liabilities and assets shall be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates. A change in tax laws or rates may also require a reevaluation of a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">valuation allowance</b> for deferred tax assets. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Deferred Credit Arising from Asset Acquisitions that Are Not Business Combinations </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">740-10-35-5   </b>A deferred credit may arise under the accounting required by paragraph 740-10-25-51 when an asset is acquired outside of a business combination. Any deferred credit arising from the application of such accounting requirements shall be amortized to income tax expense in proportion to the realization of the tax benefits that gave rise to the deferred credit.
