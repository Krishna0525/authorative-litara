      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>25-1</b> An entity shall account for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of this Topic only when all of the following criteria are met: 
      </p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. The parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally, or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations.</p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. The entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred. </p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. The entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred. </p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">d. The contract has commercial substance (that is, the risk, timing, or amount of the entity’s future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract).</p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">e. It is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. In evaluating whether collectibility of an amount of consideration is probable, an entity shall consider only the customer’s ability and intention to pay that amount of consideration when it is due. The amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled may be less than the price stated in the contract if the consideration is variable because the entity may offer the customer a price concession (see paragraph 606-10-32-7).</p>

      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>25-9</b>  An entity shall combine two or more <b>contracts</b> entered into at or
      near the same time with the same <b>customer</b> (or related parties of the customer)
      and account for the contracts as a single contract if one or more of the following
      criteria are met: 
      </p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. The contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial
      objective. </p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. The amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the
      price or performance of the other contract.  </p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">c. The goods or services promised in the contracts (or some goods or
      services promised in each of the contracts) are a single <b>performance
      obligation</b>. </p>
      
       <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>&gt;   Contract Modifications </b></p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>25-10</b> A contract modification is a change in the scope or price (or both)
      of a <b>contract</b> that is approved by the parties to the contract. In some industries
      and jurisdictions, a contract modification may be described as a change order, a
      variation, or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties to a
      contract approve a modification that either creates new or changes existing
      enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. A contract
      modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement, or implied by
      customary business practices. If the parties to the contract have not approved a
      contract modification, an entity shall continue to apply the guidance in this Topic
      to the existing contract until the contract modification is approved.

      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>25-14 At</b> contract <b>inception, an entity shall assess the goods or
      services promised in a contract with a</b> customer <b>and shall identify as a</b>
      performance obligation <b>each promise to transfer to the customer either:</b>
      </p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>a. A good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct </b></p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>b. A series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the
      same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer   </b></p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>25-15</b> A series of distinct goods or services has the same pattern of
      transfer to the customer if both of the following criteria are met:
      </p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. Each distinct good or service in the series that the entity promises to
      transfer to the customer would meet the criteria to be a performance obligation satisfied over time</p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. In accordance, the same
      method would be used to measure the entity’s progress toward
      complete satisfaction of the performance obligation to transfer each
      distinct good or service in the series to the customer </p>

      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>&gt;   Satisfaction of Performance Obligations </b></p>
      <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>25-23 An entity shall recognize</b> revenue <b>when (or as) the entity
      satisfies a</b> performance obligation <b>by transferring a promised good or service
      (that is, an asset) to a</b> customer.<b> An asset is transferred when (or as) the
      customer obtains control of that asset.</b>  
      </p>
     <!--  <p class="para" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>25-24</b>4 For each performance obligation identified, an entity shall determine at contract
      inception whether it satisfies the performance obligation over time or satisfies the performance
      obligation at a point in time. If an
      entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the performance
      obligation is satisfied at a point in time.
