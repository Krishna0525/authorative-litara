<p class="header">Scope of This Section</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="at80101">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section addresses examination engagements undertaken by a service auditor to report on controls at organizations that provide services to user entities when those controls are likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting. It complements AU section 324, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Service Organizations</i>, in that reports prepared in accordance with this section may provide appropriate evidence under AU section 324. (Ref: par. .A1)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>The focus of this section is on controls at service organizations likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting. The guidance herein also may be helpful to a practitioner performing an engagement under section 101, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attest Engagements</i>, to report on controls at a service organization 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    other than those that are likely to be relevant to user entities' internal control over financial reporting (for example, controls that affect user entities' compliance with specified requirements of laws, regulations, rules, contracts, or grants, or controls that affect user entities' production or quality control). Section 601, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compliance Attestation</i>, is applicable if a practitioner is reporting on an entity's own compliance with specified requirements or on its controls over compliance with specified requirements. (Ref: par. .A2-.A3)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    when management of the service organization is not responsible for the design of the system (for example, when the system has been designed by the user entity or the design is stipulated in a contract between the user entity and the service organization). (Ref: par. .A4) 
</p>

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03  </b>In addition to performing an examination of a service organization's controls, a service auditor may be engaged to (a) examine and report on a user entity's transactions or balances maintained by a service organization, or (b) perform and report the results of agreed upon procedures related to the controls of a service organization or to transactions or balances of a user entity maintained by a service organization. However, these engagements are not addressed in this section. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04  </b>The requirements and application material in this section are based on the premise that management of the service organization (also referred to as management) will provide the service auditor with a written assertion that is included in or attached to management's description of the service organization's system. Paragraph .10 of this section addresses the circumstance in which management refuses to provide such a written assertion. Section 101  indicates that when performing an attestation engagement, a practitioner may report directly on the subject matter or on management's assertion. For engagements conducted under this section, the service auditor is required to report directly on the subject matter.
