</p>
<p id="sec-0001" class="section">
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.01</b> This section provides guidance on reporting in a client-prepared document onâ€”
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">a. Condensed financial statements (either for an annual or an interim period) that are derived from audited financial statements of a public entity<sup>1</sup> that is required to file, at least annually, complete audited financial statements with a regulatory agency.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">b. Selected financial data that are derived from audited financial statements of either a public or a nonpublic entity and that are presented in a document that includes audited financial statements (or, with respect to a public entity, that incorporates audited financial statements by reference to information filed with a regulatory agency).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">AS 2701, <em>Auditing Supplemental Information Accompanying Audited Financial Statements</em>, sets forth the auditor's responsibilities when the auditor of the company's financial statements is engaged to perform audit procedures and report on supplemental information that accompanies financial statements audited pursuant to Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.02</b> In reporting on condensed financial statements or selected financial data in circumstances other than those described in paragraph .01, the auditor should follow the guidance in paragraphs .41 through .44 of AS 3101, <em>Reports on Audited Financial Statements</em>, AS 3305, <em>Special Reports</em>, or other applicable PCAOB auditing standards.<sup>2</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Condensed Financial Statements</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.03</b> Condensed financial statements are presented in considerably less detail than complete financial statements that are intended to present financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. For this reason, they should be read in conjunction with the entity's most recent complete financial statements that include all the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.04</b> An auditor may be engaged to report on condensed financial statements that are derived from audited financial statements. Because condensed financial statements do not constitute a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, an auditor should not report on condensed financial statements in the same manner as he reported on the complete financial statements from which they are derived. To do so might lead users to assume, erroneously, that the condensed financial statements include all the disclosures necessary for complete financial statements. For the same reason, it is desirable that the condensed financial statements be so marked.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.05</b> In the circumstances described in paragraph .01(<em>a</em>),<sup>3</sup> the auditor's report on condensed financial statements that are derived from financial statements that he has audited should indicate (<em>a</em>) that the auditor has audited and expressed an opinion on the complete financial statements, (<em>b</em>) the date of the auditor's report on the complete financial statements,<sup>4</sup> (<em>c</em>) the type of opinion expressed, and (<em>d</em>) whether, in the auditor's opinion, the information set forth in the condensed financial statements is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the complete financial statements from which it has been derived.<sup>5</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.06</b> The following is an example of wording that an auditor may use in the circumstances described in paragraph .01(<em>a</em>) to report on condensed financial statements that are derived from financial statements that he or she has audited and on which he or she has issued a standard report:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of X Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 20X0, and the related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 15, 20X1, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.07</b> A client might make a statement in a client-prepared document that names the auditor and also states that condensed financial statements have been derived from audited financial statements. Such a statement does not, in itself, require the auditor to report on the condensed financial statements, provided that they are included in a document that contains audited financial statements (or that incorporates such statements by reference to information filed with a regulatory agency). However, if such a statement is made in a client-prepared document of a public entity that is required to file, at least annually, complete audited financial statements with a regulatory agency and that document does not include audited financial statements (or does not incorporate such statements by reference to information filed with a regulatory agency),<sup>6</sup> the auditor should request that the client either (<em>a</em>) not include the auditor's name in the document or (<em>b</em>), include the auditor's report on the condensed financial statements, as described in paragraph .05. If the client will neither delete the reference to the auditor nor allow the appropriate report to be included, the auditor should advise the client that he does not consent to either the use of his name or the reference to him, and he should consider what other actions might be appropriate.<sup>7</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.08</b> Condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of a public entity may be presented on a comparative basis with interim financial information as of a subsequent date that is accompanied by the auditor's review report. In that case, the auditor should report on the condensed financial statements of each period in a manner appropriate for the type of service provided for each period. The following is an example of a review report on a condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 19X1, and the related condensed statements of income and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 19X1 and 19X0, together with a report on a condensed balance sheet derived from audited financial statements as of December 31, 19X0, included in Form 10-Q:<sup>8</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of ABC Company and subsidiaries as of March 31, 19X1, and the related condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 19X1 and 19X0. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Over Board, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 20X0, and the related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 15, 20X1, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 20X0, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Selected Financial Data</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.09</b> An auditor may be engaged to report on selected financial data that are included in a client-prepared document that contains audited financial statements (or, with respect to a public entity, that incorporates such statements by reference to information filed with a regulatory agency). Selected financial data are not a required part of the basic financial statements, and the entity's management is responsible for determining the specific selected financial data to be presented.<sup>9</sup> If the auditor is engaged to report on the selected financial data, his report should be limited to data that are derived from audited financial statements (which may include data that are calculated from amounts presented in the financial statements, such as working capital). If the selected financial data that management presents include both data derived from audited financial statements and other information (such as number of employees or square footage of facilities), the auditor's report should specifically identify the data on which he is reporting. The report should indicate (<em>a</em>) that the auditor has audited and expressed an opinion on the complete financial statements, (<em>b</em>) the type of opinion expressed,<sup>10</sup> and (<em>c</em>) whether, in the auditor's opinion, the information set forth in the selected financial data is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the complete financial statements from which it has been derived.<sup>11</sup> If the selected financial data for any of the years presented are derived from financial statements that were audited by another independent auditor, the report on the selected financial data should state that fact, and the auditor should not express an opinion on that data.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.10</b> The following is an example of an auditor's report that includes an additional paragraph because he is also engaged to report on selected financial data for a five-year period ended December 31, 19X5, in a client-prepared document that includes audited financial statements:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of ABC Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 19X5 and 19X4, and the related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 19X5. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provided a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the ABC Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 20X5 and 20X4, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 20X5, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We have also previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 20X3, 20X2, and 20X1, and the related statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 20X2, and 20X1 (none of which are presented herein); and we expressed unqualified opinions on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the selected financial data for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 20X5, appearing on page xx, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.11</b> In introductory material regarding the selected financial data included in a client-prepared document, an entity might name the independent auditor and state that the data are derived from financial statements that he audited. Such a statement does not, in itself, require the auditor to report on the selected financial data, provided that the selected financial data are presented in a document that contains audited financial statements (or, with respect to a public entity, that incorporates such statements by reference to information filed with a regulatory agency). If such a statement is made in a document that does not include (or incorporate by reference) audited financial statements, the auditor should request that neither his name nor reference to him be associated with the information, or he should disclaim an opinion on the selected financial data and request that the disclaimer be included in the document. If the client does not comply, the auditor should advise the client that he does not consent to either the use of his name or the reference to him, and he should consider what other actions might be appropriate.<sup>12</sup></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Effective Date</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>.12</b> This section is effective for reports issued or reissued on or after January 1, 1989. Earlier application of the provision of this section is permissible.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><b>Footnotes (AS 3315 - Reporting on Condensed Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data):</b></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">1. <em>Public entity</em> is defined in footnote 2 of AS 3320, <em>Association with Financial Statements</em>.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">2. An auditor who has audited and reported on complete financial statements of a nonpublic entity may subsequently be requested to compile financial statements for the same period that omit substantially all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. Reporting on comparative financial statements in those circumstances is described in SSARS No. 2, paragraphs 29 and 30 [AR section 200.29 and .30].</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">3. SEC regulations require certain registrants to include in filings, as a supplementary schedule to the consolidated financial statements, condensed financial information of the parent company. The auditor should report on such condensed financial information in the same manner as he reports on other supplementary schedules.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">4. Reference to the date of the original report removes any implication that records, transactions, or events after that date have been examined. The auditor does not have a responsibility to investigate or inquire further into events that may have occurred during the period between the date of the report on the complete financial statements and the date of the report on the condensed financial statements. (However, see AS 4101, <em>Responsibilities Regarding</em> <em>Filings Under Federal Securities Statutes</em>, regarding the auditor's responsibility when his report is included in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933.)
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">5. If the auditor's opinion on the complete financial statements was other than unqualified, the report should describe the nature of, and the reasons for, the qualification. The auditor should also consider the effect that any modification of the report on the complete financial statements might have on the report on the condensed financial statements or selected financial data. For example, if the auditor's report on the complete financial statements referred to another auditor or included an explanatory paragraph because of a material uncertainty, a going concern matter, or an inconsistency in the application of accounting principles, the report on the condensed financial statements should state that fact. However, no reference to the inconsistency is necessary if a change in accounting referred to in the auditor's report on the complete financial statements does not affect the comparability of the information being presented.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">6. If such a statement is made in a client-prepared document that does not include audited financial statements and the client is not a public entity that is required to file complete audited financial statements with a regulatory agency (at least annually), the auditor would ordinarily express an adverse opinion on the condensed financial statements because of inadequate disclosure. (<em>See</em> AS 3101.41 through .44.) The auditor would not be expected to provide the disclosure in his report. The following is an example of an auditor's report on condensed financial statements in such circumstances when the auditor had previously audited and reported on the complete financial statements:
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of X Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 20X0, and the related earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein). These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 20X0, and the related condensed statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended, presented on pages xx-xx, are presented as a summary and therefore do not include all of the disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, because of the significance of the omission of the information referred to in the preceding paragraph, the condensed consolidated financial statements referred to above do not present fairly, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of X Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 20X0, or the results of its operations or its cash flows for the year then ended.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">7. In considering what other actions, if any, may be appropriate in these circumstances, the auditor may wish to consult his legal counsel.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">8. Regulation S-X specifies that the following financial information should be provided in filings on Form 10-Q:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><em>a</em>. An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter and a balance sheet (which may be condensed to the same extent as the interim balance sheet) as of the end of the preceding fiscal year.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><em>b</em>. Interim condensed statements of income for the most recent fiscal quarter, for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the corresponding periods of the preceding fiscal year.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;"><em>c</em>. Interim condensed cash flow statements for the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter and for the corresponding period for the preceding fiscal year. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires a registrant to engage an independent accountant to review the registrant's interim financial information before the registrant files its interim financial information on Form 10-Q or Form 10-QSB. If the auditor has made a review of interim financial information, he may agree to the reference to his name and the inclusion of his review report in a Form 10-Q. (<em>See</em> paragraph .03 of AS 4105, <em>Reviews of</em> <em>Interim Financial Information</em>.)
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">9. Under regulations of the SEC, certain reports must include, for each of the last five fiscal years, selected financial data in accordance with regulation S-K, including net sales or operating revenues, income or loss from continuing operations, income or loss from continuing operations per common share, total assets, long-term obligations and redeemable preferred stock and cash dividends declared per common share. Registrants may include additional items that they believe may be useful. There is no SEC requirement for the auditor to report on selected financial data.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">10. <em>See</em> footnote 5.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">11. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude an auditor from expressing an opinion on one or more specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement, providing the provisions of AS 3305 are observed.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="margin-bottom:8pt;">12. <em>See</em> footnote 7.
