<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ar12001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARSs) provide guidance concerning the standards and procedures applicable when an accountant is engaged to report on compiled financial statements or submits financial statements to his or her client or third parties. By definition, presentations of pro forma financial information are not financial statements. This statement expands SSARSs to apply when an accountant is engaged to report or issues a report on compiled pro forma financial information. If, however, the pro forma financial information is included as supplementary information, the accountant should refer to paragraph .53 of section 80, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compilation of Financial Statements</i>. [Paragraph revised, December 2010, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SSARS No. 19.]
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>A compilation of pro forma financial information is limited to assisting management (owners) in presenting financial information without undertaking to obtain or provide any assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to that information. [Paragraph revised, December 2010, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SSARS No. 19.]
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03  </b>The objective of pro forma financial information is to show what the significant effects on historical financial information might have been had a consummated or proposed transaction (or event) occurred at an earlier date. Pro forma financial information is commonly used to show the effects of transactions such as the following:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>Business combination</li>
<li>Change in capitalization</li>
<li>Disposition of a significant portion of the business</li>
<li>Change in the form of business organization or status as an autonomous entity</li>
<li>Proposed sale of securities and the application of the proceeds</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04  </b>This objective is achieved primarily by applying pro forma adjustments to historical financial information. Pro forma adjustments should be based on management???s assumptions and give effect to all significant effects directly attributable to the transaction (or event).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05  </b>Pro forma financial information should be labeled as such to distinguish it from historical financial information. This presentation should describe the transaction (or event) that is reflected in the pro forma financial information, the source of the historical financial information on which it is based, the significant assumptions used in developing the pro forma adjustments, and any significant uncertainties about those assumptions. The presentation should also indicate that the pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the related historical financial information and that the pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results (such as financial position and results of operations, as applicable) that would have been attained had the transaction (or event) actually taken place earlier.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Conditions for Compiling Pro Forma Financial Information</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ar12006">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06  </b>Nothing in this statement is intended to preclude an accountant from assisting management (owners) in presenting pro forma financial information and submitting such pro forma financial information to the client or to third parties without the issuance of a compilation report, unless the accountant has been engaged to report on such compiled pro forma financial information. If an accountant assists management (owners) in presenting pro forma financial information,<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[fn 1]</sup>  the accountant should consider how such a presentation of pro forma financial information will be used. The accountant should consider the potential of being associated with pro forma financial information and the likelihood that the user may inappropriately infer, through that association, an unintended level of reliance on the information. If the accountant believes that he or she will be associated with the information, the accountant should consider issuing a compilation report so a user will not infer an unintended level of reliance on the information. [Paragraph revised, December 2010, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SSARS No. 19.]
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07  </b>An engagement to report on compiled pro forma financial information may be undertaken as a separate engagement or in conjunction with a compilation of financial statements. The accountant may agree to compile pro forma financial information only if the document that contains the pro forma financial information includes (or incorporates by reference) the historical financial statements of the entity on which the pro forma financial information is based. Historical interim financial information may be presented in condensed form. In the case of a business combination, the document should include (or incorporate by reference) the appropriate historical financial information for the significant constituent parts of the combined entity. [Paragraph revised, December 2010, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SSARS No. 19.]
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08  </b>Additionally, the historical financial statements of the entity (or, in the case of a business combination, of each significant constituent part of the combined entity) on which the pro forma financial information is based must have been compiled, reviewed, or audited. The accountant's compilation or review report or the auditor???s report on the historical financial statements should be included (or incorporated by reference) in the document containing the pro forma financial information.
</p>

</p>




<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<p class="header">Understanding With the Entity</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ar12009">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.09  </b>When an accountant is engaged to report on compiled pro forma financial information, the accountant should establish an understanding with management regarding the services to be performed and should document the understanding through a written communication with management. Such an understanding reduces the risks that either the accountant or management may misinterpret the needs or expectations of the other party. For example, it reduces the risk that management may inappropriately rely on the accountant to protect the entity against certain risks or perform certain functions that are management's responsibility. The accountant should ensure that the understanding includes the objectives of the engagement, management's responsibilities, the accountant's responsibilities, and the limitations of the engagement. In some cases, the accountant may establish such understanding with those charged with governance. An understanding with management and, if applicable, those charged with governance regarding a compilation of pro forma financial information should include the following matters:


<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li>The objective of a compilation of pro forma information is to assist management in presenting such financial information.</li>

<li>The accountant utilizes information that is the representation of management (owners) without undertaking to obtain any assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the pro forma financial information in order for the pro forma financial information to be in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.</li>

<li>Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the pro forma financial information in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.</li>

<li>Management is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the pro forma financial information.</li>

<li>Management is responsible for the prevention and detection of fraud.</li>

<li>Management is responsible for identifying and ensuring that the entity complies with the laws and regulations applicable to its activities.</li>

<li>Management is responsible for making all financial records and related information available to the accountant.</li>

<li>The accountant is responsible for conducting the engagement in accordance with SSARSs issued by the AICPA.</li>

<li>A compilation differs significantly from a review or an audit of pro forma financial information. A compilation does not contemplate performing inquiry, analytical procedures, or other procedures performed in a review. Additionally, a compilation does not contemplate obtaining an understanding of the entity's internal control; assessing fraud risk; testing accounting records by obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence through inspection, observation, confirmation, or the examination of source documents (for example, cancelled checks or bank images); or other procedures ordinarily performed in an audit. Accordingly, the accountant will not express an opinion or provide any assurance regarding the pro forma financial information.</li>

<li>The engagement cannot be relied upon to disclose errors, fraud,<sup>fn 2</sup> or illegal acts.<sup>fn 3</sup>
</li>

<li>The accountant will inform the appropriate level of management of any material errors and of any evidence or information that comes to the accountant's attention during the performance of compilation procedures<sup>fn 4</sup> that fraud or an illegal act may have occurred.<sup>fn 5</sup>  The accountant need not report any matters regarding illegal acts that may have occurred that are clearly inconsequential and may reach agreement in advance with the entity on the nature of any such matters to be communicated.</li>

<li>The effect of any independence impairments on the expected form of the accountant's compilation report, if applicable.</li>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.10  </b>When the accountant is engaged to report on compiled pro forma financial information and evidence or information comes to his or her attention during the engagement that fraud or an illegal act may have occurred, the accountant should adhere to the communication requirements contained in paragraphs .54-.55 of section 80. [Paragraph revised, December 2010, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SSARS No. 19.]

<p class="header">Performance Requirements</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ar12011">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.11  </b>When the accountant is engaged to report on compiled pro forma financial information, he or she should adhere to the compilation performance requirements contained in paragraphs .06-.13 of section 80. [Paragraph revised, December 2010, to reflect conforming changes necessary due to the issuance of SSARS No. 19.]
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.12  </b>Before issuance of a compilation report on pro forma financial information, the accountant should read such compiled pro forma financial information, including the summary of significant assumptions,<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 6</sup> and consider whether the information appears to be appropriate in form and free of obvious material errors. In this context, the term <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">error</i> refers to mistakes in the compilation of the pro forma financial information, including arithmetical or clerical mistakes, and mistakes in the application of accounting principles, including inadequate disclosures.

<p class="header">Reporting Requirements</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ar12014">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.14  </b>The accountant's objective in reporting on compiled pro forma financial information is to prevent misunderstanding of the degree of responsibility the accountant is assuming when his or her name is associated with the pro forma financial information. When the accountant issues a compilation report on pro forma financial information, the basic elements of the report are as follows:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Title</i>. The accountant's compilation report should have a title that clearly indicates that it is the accountant's compilation report. The accountant may indicate that he or she is independent in the title, if applicable. Appropriate titles would be "Accountant's Compilation Report" or "Independent Accountant's Compilation Report."
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Addressee</i>. The accountant's report should be addressed as appropriate in the circumstances of the engagement.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.    <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Introductory paragraph</i>. The introductory paragraph in the accountant's report should

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">iv.    specify the date or period covered by the pro forma financial information.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">v.    reference the financial statements from which the historical financial information is derived and include a statement on whether such financial statements were compiled, reviewed, or audited. (The report on pro forma financial information should refer to any modifications in the accountant's or auditor's report on historical financial statements.)
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">vi.    include a statement that the accountant has not audited or reviewed the pro forma financial information and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or provide any assurance about whether pro forma financial information is in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">vii.    if the compilation was performed in conjunction with a compilation of the entity's financial statements, the paragraph should so state and indicate the date of the accountant's compilation report on those financial statements. Furthermore, any departure from the standard report on those statements should also be disclosed if considered relevant to the presentation of the pro forma financial information.

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">h.    <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Signature of the accountant</i>. The manual or printed signature of the accounting firm or the accountant, as appropriate.

<p class="header">Reporting When the Accountant Is Not Independent</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="ar12017">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.17  </b>When the accountant is issuing a report with respect to a compilation of pro forma financial information for an entity, with respect to which the accountant is not independent, the accountant's report should be modified. In making a judgment about whether he or she is independent, the accountant should be guided by the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. The accountant should indicate his or her lack of independence in a final paragraph of the accountant's compilation report. An example of such a disclosure would be<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[fn 9]</sup>  If the accountant is not independent, he or she should specifically disclose the lack of independence. However, the reason for the lack of independence should not be described. When the accountant is not independent, the following should be included as the last paragraph of the report:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">I am (we are) not independent with respect to XYZ Company.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The accountant is not precluded from disclosing a description about the reason(s) that his or her independence is impaired. The following are examples of descriptions the accountant may use:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.    I am (We are) not independent with respect to XYZ Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 20XX, because I (a member of the engagement team) had a direct financial interest in XYZ Company.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.    I am (We are) not independent with respect to XYZ Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 20XX, because an individual of my immediate family (an immediate family member of one of the members of the engagement team) was employed by XYZ Company.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.    I am (We are) not independent with respect to XYZ Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 20XX, because I (we) performed certain accounting services (the accountant may include a specific description of those services) that impaired my (our) independence.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">If the accountant elects to disclose a description about the reasons his or her independence is impaired, the accountant should ensure that all reasons are included in the description.

However, the determination about whether a particular act is fraudulent or illegal would generally be based on the advice of an informed expert qualified to practice law or may have to await final determination by a court of law.
