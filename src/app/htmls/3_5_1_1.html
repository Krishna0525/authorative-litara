</p><p id="33060">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-1</b>  Paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">835-20-05-1</u> states that the historical cost of acquiring an asset includes the costs necessarily incurred to bring it to the condition and location necessary for its intended use. As indicated in that paragraph, if an asset requires a period of time in which to carry out the activities necessary to bring it to that condition and location, the interest cost incurred during that period as a result of expenditures for the asset is a part of the historical cost of acquiring the asset.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-3</b>  An interest in the residual value of a leased asset recognized under paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">360-10-25-4</u> shall be measured initially at the amount of cash disbursed, the fair value of other consideration given, and the present value of liabilities assumed.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30-4</b>  The fair value of the interest in the residual value of the leased asset at the date of the agreement shall be used to measure its cost if that fair value is more clearly evident than the fair value of assets surrendered, services rendered, or liabilities assumed.
