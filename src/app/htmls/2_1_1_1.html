<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Other Presentation Matters Section provides guidance on other presentation matters not addressed in the Recognition, Initial Measurement, Subsequent Measurement, and Derecognition Sections. Other presentation matters may include items such as current or long-term balance sheet classification, cash flow presentation, earnings per share matters, and so forth. The FASB Codification also contains Presentation Topics, which provide guidance for general presentation and display items. See those Topics for general guidance.

<p class="header">&gt;&gt; Criteria for Presentation as Extraordinary Items</p>
<p id="22545">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-1</b>  Judgment is required to segregate in the income statement the effects of events or transactions that are <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">extraordinary items</b> (as required by paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-20-45-10 through 45-11</u>).  An event or transaction shall be presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity, the effects of which shall be included in income from operations, unless the evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item as defined in this Subtopic.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-2</b>  Extraordinary items are events and transactions that are distinguished by their <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">unusual nature</b> and by the infrequency of their occurrence. Thus, both of the following criteria shall be met to classify an event or transaction as an extraordinary item:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Unusual nature. The underlying event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the entity, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-20-55-1</u>).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Infrequency of occurrence.</b> The underlying event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-20-55-2</u>).
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-3</b>  The effect of an extraordinary event or transaction shall be classified separately in the income statement in the manner described in paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-20-45-10 through 45-11</u> if it is material in relation to income before extraordinary items or to the trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items, or is material by other appropriate criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the aggregate in determining whether an extraordinary event or transaction is material. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action that otherwise meets the two criteria in the preceding paragraph shall be aggregated to determine materiality.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4</b>  Certain gains and losses shall not be reported as extraordinary items (except as indicated in the following paragraph) because they are usual in nature or may be expected to recur as a consequence of customary and continuing business activities. Examples include all of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a. Write-down or write-off of receivables, inventories, equipment leased to others, deferred research and development costs, or other intangible assets
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. Gains or losses from exchange or translation of foreign currencies, including those relating to major devaluations and revaluations
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. Gains or losses on disposal of a component of an entity
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d. Other gains or losses from sale or abandonment of property, plant, or equipment used in the business
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e. Effects of a strike, including those against competitors and major suppliers
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f. Adjustment of accruals on long-term contracts.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-5</b>  In rare situations, an event or transaction may occur that clearly meets both criteria specified in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-20-45-2</u> and thus gives rise to an extraordinary gain or loss that includes one or more of the gains or losses enumerated in the preceding paragraph. In these circumstances, gains or losses such as those in (a) and (d) of the preceding paragraph shall be included in the extraordinary item if they are a direct result of a major casualty (such as an earthquake), an expropriation, or a prohibition under a newly enacted law or regulation that clearly meets both criteria specified in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-20-45-2</u>. However, any portion of such losses which would have resulted from a valuation of assets on a going concern basis shall not be included in the extraordinary items.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-6</b>  Disposals of a component of an entity shall be accounted for and presented in the income statement in accordance with Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">205-20</u> even though the circumstances of the disposal meet the criteria specified in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-20-45-2</u>.
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-7</b>  See paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-20-55-4</u> for examples of events or transactions that do not meet both of the extraordinary item criteria of paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">225-20-45-2</u>.
</p>
<p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Criteria Exceptions
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-8</b>  As indicated in paragraph 225-20-15-2, the net effect of discontinuing the application of regulatory operations accounting addressed in Section 980-20-40 shall be recognized as an extraordinary item regardless of whether the criteria in paragraph 225-20-45-2 are met.
</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt;  Presentation of Extraordinary Items</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-9</b>  Extraordinary items shall be segregated from the results of ordinary operations and shown separately in the income statement, with disclosure of the nature and amounts thereof.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-10</b>  In the absence of discounted operations (see paragraphs 205-20-45-1 through 45-5, which address the reporting of discontinued operations), the following main captions shall appear in an income statement if extraordinary items are reported.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
</p>
<table xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<tbody><tr>
<td>Income before extraordinary items</td>
<td align="right">$XXX</td>

<td>Extraordinary items (less applicable income taxes of $___) (Note___)</td>
<td align="right">

<tr>
<td>Net Income</td>
<td align="right">$XXX</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-11</b>  The caption extraordinary items shall be used to identify separately the effects of events and transactions other than disposal of component of an entity, that meet the criteria for classification as extraordinary as discussed in paragraphs 225-20-45-1 through 45-6.  Descriptive captions and the amounts for individual extraordinary events and transactions shall be presented, preferably on the face of the income statement, if practicable; otherwise disclosure in related notes is acceptable.  The nature of an extraordinary event or transaction and the principal items entering into the determination if an extraordinary gain or loss shall be described.  The income taxes applicable to extraordinary items shall be disclosed on the face of the income statement; alternatively, disclosed in the related notes is acceptable.  The caption net income shall replace the three captions shown in the preceding paragraph if the income statement includes no extraordinary items.</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-12</b>  Earnings per share (EPS) data for extraordinary items shall be presented either on the face of the income statement or in the related notes, as prescribed by Section 260-10-45.</p><p>
<p class="header">&gt; &gt;  Adjustment of Amounts Reported in Prior Periods</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-13</b>  Circumstances attendant to extraordinary items frequently require estimates, for example, of associated costs and occasionally of associated revenue, based on judgment and evaluation of the facts known at the time of first accounting for the event.  Each adjustment in the current period of an element of an extraordinary item that was reported in a prior period shall be classified separately in the current period in the same manner as the original item.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-14</b>  If the adjustment is the correction of an error, the provisions of paragraphs 250-10-45-23 and 250-10-50-7 shall be applied.
