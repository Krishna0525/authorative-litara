<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scope of This Section</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24001">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.01  </b>This section addresses the auditor's responsibilities relating to fraud in an audit of financial statements. Specifically, it expands on how section 315, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the Entity and Its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement</i>, and section 330, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Performing Audit Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks and Evaluating the Audit Evidence Obtained</i>, are to be applied regarding risks of material misstatement due to fraud.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Characteristics of Fraud</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24002">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.02  </b>Misstatements in the financial statements can arise from either fraud or error. The distinguishing factor between fraud and error is whether the underlying action that results in the misstatement of the financial statements is intentional or unintentional.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24003">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.03  </b>Although fraud is a broad legal concept, for the purposes of generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), the auditor is primarily concerned with fraud that causes a material misstatement in the financial statements. Two types of intentional misstatements are relevant to the auditor—misstatements resulting from fraudulent financial reporting and misstatements resulting from misappropriation of assets. Although the auditor may suspect or, in rare cases, identify the occurrence of fraud, the auditor does not make legal determinations of whether fraud has actually occurred.
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responsibility for the Prevention and Detection of Fraud</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24004">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.04  </b>The primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. It is important that management, with the oversight of those charged with governance, places a strong emphasis on fraud prevention, which may reduce opportunities for fraud to take place, and fraud deterrence, which could persuade individuals not to commit fraud because of the likelihood of detection and punishment. This involves a commitment to creating a culture of honesty and ethical behavior, which can be reinforced by active oversight by those charged with governance. Oversight by those charged with governance includes considering the potential for override of controls or other inappropriate influence over the financial reporting process, such as efforts by management to manage earnings in order to influence the perceptions of financial statement users regarding the entityￃﾢￂￂﾙs performance and profitability.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<i>Responsibilities of the Auditor</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24005">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.05  </b>An auditor conducting an audit in accordance with GAAS is responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. Due to the inherent limitations of an audit, an unavoidable risk exists that some material misstatements of the financial statements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with GAAS.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 1</sup>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24006">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.06  </b>As described in section 200, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance With Generally Accepted Auditing Standards</i>, the potential effects of inherent limitations are particularly significant in the case of misstatement resulting from fraud.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 2</sup> The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error. This is because fraud may involve sophisticated and carefully organized schemes designed to conceal it, such as forgery, deliberate failure to record transactions, or intentional misrepresentations being made to the auditor. Such attempts at concealment may be even more difficult to detect when accompanied by collusion. Collusion may cause the auditor to believe that audit evidence is persuasive when it is, in fact, false. The auditor's ability to detect a fraud depends on factors such as the skillfulness of the perpetrator, the frequency and extent of manipulation, the degree of collusion involved, the relative size of individual amounts manipulated, and the seniority of those individuals involved. Although the auditor may be able to identify potential opportunities for fraud to be perpetrated, it is difficult for the auditor to determine whether misstatements in judgment areas, such as accounting estimates, are caused by fraud or error.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24007">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.07  </b>Furthermore, the risk of the auditor not detecting a material misstatement resulting from management fraud is greater than for employee fraud because management is frequently in a position to directly or indirectly manipulate accounting records, present fraudulent financial information, or override control procedures designed to prevent similar frauds by other employees.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24008">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.08  </b>When obtaining reasonable assurance, the auditor is responsible for maintaining professional skepticism throughout the audit, considering the potential for management override of controls, and recognizing the fact that audit procedures that are effective for detecting error may not be effective in detecting fraud. The requirements in this section are designed to assist the auditor in identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement due to fraud and in designing procedures to detect such misstatement.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.16  </b>When performing risk assessment procedures and related activities to obtain an understanding of the entity and its environment, including the entity's internal control, required by section 315, the auditor should perform the procedures in paragraphs .17-.24 to obtain information for use in identifying the risks of material misstatement due to fraud.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5</sup>
</p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24034">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.34  </b>The auditor should evaluate, at or near the end of the audit, whether the accumulated results of auditing procedures (including analytical procedures that were performed as substantive tests or when forming an overall conclusion) affect the assessment of the risks of material misstatement due to fraud made earlier in the audit or indicate a previously unrecognized risk of material misstatement due to fraud. If not already performed when forming an overall conclusion, the analytical procedures relating to revenue, required by paragraph .22, should be performed through the end of the reporting period.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24035">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.35  </b>If the auditor identifies a misstatement, the auditor should evaluate whether such a misstatement is indicative of fraud. If such an indication exists, the auditor should evaluate the implications of the misstatement with regard to other aspects of the audit, particularly the auditor's evaluation of materiality, management and employee integrity, and the reliability of management representations, recognizing that an instance of fraud is unlikely to be an isolated occurrence. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24036">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.36  </b>If the auditor identifies a misstatement, whether material or not, and the auditor has reason to believe that it is, or may be, the result of fraud and that management (in particular, senior management) is involved, the auditor should reevaluate the assessment of the risks of material misstatement due to fraud and its resulting effect on the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures to respond to the assessed risks. The auditor should also consider whether circumstances or conditions indicate possible collusion involving employees, management, or third parties when reconsidering the reliability of evidence previously obtained.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc24037">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.37  </b>If the auditor concludes that, or is unable to conclude whether, the financial statements are materially misstated as a result of fraud, the auditor should evaluate the implications for the audit.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">

<i>Evaluation of Fraud Risk Factors</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a28">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A28  </b>The fact that fraud is usually concealed can make it very difficult to detect. Nevertheless, the auditor may identify events or conditions that indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud (fraud risk factors), such as the following: 

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>The need to meet expectations of third parties to obtain additional equity financing may create pressure to commit fraud.</li>

<li>The granting of significant bonuses if unrealistic profit targets are met may create an incentive to commit fraud.</li>

<li>A control environment that is not effective may create an opportunity to commit fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a29">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A29  </b>Fraud risk factors cannot easily be ranked in order of importance. The significance of fraud risk factors varies widely. Some of these factors will be present in entities in which the specific conditions do not present risks of material misstatement. Accordingly, the determination of whether a fraud risk factor is present and whether it is to be considered in assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud requires the exercise of professional judgment.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a30">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A30  </b>Examples of fraud risk factors related to fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets are presented in appendix A, "Examples of Fraud Risk Factors." These illustrative risk factors are classified based on the three conditions that are generally present when fraud exists:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>An incentive or pressure to commit fraud</li>

<li>A perceived opportunity to commit fraud</li>

<li>An ability to rationalize the fraudulent action</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The inability to observe one or more of these conditions does not necessarily mean that no risk of material misstatement due to fraud exists.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Risk factors reflective of an attitude that permits rationalization of the fraudulent action may not be susceptible to observation by the auditor. Nevertheless, the auditor may become aware of the existence of such information. Although the fraud risk factors described in appendix A cover a broad range of situations that may be faced by auditors, they are only examples and other risk factors may exist.
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a31">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A31  </b>The size, complexity, and ownership characteristics of the entity have a significant influence on the consideration of relevant fraud risk factors. For example, in the case of a large entity, there may be factors that generally constrain improper conduct by management, such as

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" align="center">
</p><ul>
<li>effective oversight by those charged with governance.</li>

<li>an effective internal audit function.</li>

<li>the existence and enforcement of a written code of conduct.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Furthermore, fraud risk factors considered at a business segment operating level may provide different insights when compared with those obtained when considered at an entity-wide level.
</p>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerations Specific to Smaller, Less Complex Entities</i>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a32">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A32  </b>In the case of a small entity, some or all of these considerations may be inapplicable or less relevant. For example, a smaller entity may not have a written code of conduct but, instead, may have developed a culture that emphasizes the importance of integrity and ethical behavior through oral communication and by management example. Domination of management by a single individual in a small entity does not generally, in and of itself, indicate a failure by management to display and communicate an appropriate attitude regarding internal control and the financial reporting process. In some entities, the need for management authorization can compensate for otherwise deficient controls and reduce the risk of employee fraud. However, domination of management by a single individual can be a potential deficiency in internal control because an opportunity exists for management override of controls.

<i>Risks of Fraud in Revenue Recognition</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a33">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A33  </b>Material misstatement due to fraudulent financial reporting relating to revenue recognition often results from an overstatement of revenues through, for example, premature revenue recognition or recording fictitious revenues. It may result also from an understatement of revenues through, for example, improperly shifting revenues to a later period.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a34">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A34  </b>The risks of fraud in revenue recognition may be greater in some entities than others. For example, there may be pressures or incentives on management to commit fraudulent financial reporting through inappropriate revenue recognition when, for example, performance is measured in terms of year over year revenue growth or profit. Similarly, for example, there may be greater risks of fraud in revenue recognition in the case of entities that generate a substantial portion of revenues through cash sales.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a35">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A35  </b>The presumption that risks of fraud exist in revenue recognition may be rebutted. For example, the auditor may conclude that no risk of material misstatement due to fraud relating to revenue recognition exists in the case in which a single type of simple revenue transaction exists, for example, leasehold revenue from a single unit rental property.

</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a36">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A36  </b>Management may make judgments on the nature and extent of the controls it chooses to implement, and the nature and extent of the risks it chooses to assume.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fn 19</sup> In determining which controls to implement to prevent and detect fraud, management considers the risks that the financial statements may be materially misstated as a result of fraud. As part of this consideration, management may conclude that it is not cost effective to implement and maintain a particular control in relation to the reduction in the risks of material misstatement due to fraud to be achieved.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a37">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A37  </b>It is, therefore, important for the auditor to obtain an understanding of the controls that management has designed, implemented, and maintained to prevent and detect fraud. In doing so, the auditor may learn, for example, that management has consciously chosen to accept the risks associated with a lack of segregation of duties. Information from obtaining this understanding may also be useful in identifying fraud risks factors that may affect the auditor's assessment of the risks that the financial statements may contain material misstatement due to fraud.

<i>Unpredictability in the Selection of Audit Procedures</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a42">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A42  </b>Incorporating an element of unpredictability in the selection of the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures to be performed is important because individuals within the entity who are familiar with the audit procedures normally performed on engagements may be better able to conceal fraudulent financial reporting. This can be achieved by, for example,

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>performing substantive procedures on selected account balances and assertions not otherwise tested due to their materiality or risk.</li>

<li>adjusting the timing of audit procedures from that otherwise expected.</li>

<li>using different sampling methods.</li>

<li>performing audit procedures at different locations or at locations on an unannounced basis.</li>
</ul>

<i>Audit Procedures Responsive to Assessed Risks of Material Misstatement Due to Fraud at the Assertion Level</i>
</b>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a43">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A43  </b>The auditor's responses to address the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud at the assertion level may include changing the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures in the following ways:

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
</p><ul>
<li>The nature of audit procedures to be performed may need to be changed to obtain audit evidence that is more reliable and relevant or to obtain additional corroborative information. This may affect both the type of audit procedures to be performed and their combination. For example:

<ul>
<li>Physical observation or inspection of certain assets may become more important, or the auditor may choose to use computer-assisted audit techniques to gather more evidence about data contained in significant accounts or electronic transaction files.</li>

<li>The auditor may design procedures to obtain additional corroborative information. For example, if the auditor identifies that management is under pressure to meet earnings expectations, there may be a related risk that management is inflating sales by entering into sales agreements that include terms that preclude revenue recognition or by invoicing sales before delivery. In these circumstances, the auditor may, for example, design external confirmations not only to confirm outstanding amounts, but also to confirm the details of the sales agreements, including date, any rights of return, and delivery terms. In addition, the auditor might find it effective to supplement such external confirmations with inquiries of nonfinancial personnel in the entity regarding any changes in sales agreements and delivery terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The timing of substantive procedures may need to be modified. The auditor may conclude that performing substantive testing at or near the period end better addresses an assessed risk of material misstatement due to fraud. The auditor may conclude that, given the assessed risks of intentional misstatement or manipulation, audit procedures to extend audit conclusions from an interim date to the period end would not be effective. In contrast, because an intentional misstatement—for example, a misstatement involving improper revenue recognition—may have been initiated in an interim period, the auditor may elect to apply substantive procedures to transactions occurring earlier in or throughout the reporting period.</li>

<li>The extent of the procedures applied reflects the assessment of the risks of material misstatement due to fraud. For example, increasing sample sizes or performing analytical procedures at a more detailed level may be appropriate. Also, computer-assisted audit techniques may enable more extensive testing of electronic transactions and account files. Such techniques can be used to select sample transactions from key electronic files, to sort transactions with specific characteristics, or to test an entire population instead of a sample.</li>
</ul>

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A44  </b>If the auditor identifies a risk of material misstatement due to fraud that affects inventory quantities, examining the entity's inventory records may help to identify locations or items that require specific attention during or after the physical inventory count. Such a review may lead to a decision to observe inventory counts at certain locations on an unannounced basis or to conduct inventory counts at all locations on the same date.
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;" id="auc240a45">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A45  </b>The auditor may identify a risk of material misstatement due to fraud affecting a number of accounts and assertions. These may include asset valuation, estimates relating to specific transactions (such as acquisitions, restructurings, or disposals of segments of the business), and other significant accrued liabilities (such as pension and other postemployment benefit obligations, or environmental remediation liabilities). The risk may also relate to significant changes in assumptions relating to recurring estimates. Information gathered through obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment may assist the auditor in evaluating the reasonableness of such management estimates and underlying judgments and assumptions. A retrospective review of similar management judgments and assumptions applied in prior periods may also provide insight about the reasonableness of judgments and assumptions supporting management estimates.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.A46  </b>Examples of possible audit procedures to address the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, including those that illustrate the incorporation of an element of unpredictability, are presented in appendix B, "Examples of Possible Audit Procedures to Address the Assessed Risks of Material Misstatement Due to Fraud." The appendixt includes examples of responses to the auditor's assessment of the risks of material misstatement resulting from both fraudulent financial reporting, including fraudulent financial reporting resulting from revenue recognition, and misappropriation of assets.
