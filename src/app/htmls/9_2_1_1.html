</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Note:</b>  The Other Presentation Matters Section provides guidance on other presentation matters not addressed in the Recognition, Initial Measurement, Subsequent Measurement, and Derecognition Sections.  Other presentation matters may include items such as current or long-term balance sheet classification, cash flow presentation, earnings per share matters, and so forth.  The FASB Codification also contains Presentation Topics, which provide guidance for general presentation and display items.  See those Topics for general guidance.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General</b>
</p><p id="95445">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-1</b>  Health care entities, including not-for-profit, business-oriented health care entities, shall classify assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent as discussed in Section 210-10-45.  However, rather than presenting a classified balance sheet, a continuing care retirement community instead may sequence assets according to their nearness of conversion to cash and may sequence liabilities according to the nearness of the maturity and resulting use of cash.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Unrestricted Net Assets</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-2</b>  Unrestricted net assets of not-for-profit, business-oriented health care entities include assets whose use is contractually limited, such as the following:

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Proceeds of debt issues and funds of the not-for-profit, business-oriented health care entity deposited with a trustee and limited to use in accordance with the requirements of a indenture or similar agreement.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Other assets limited to use for identified purposes through an agreement between the not-for-profit, business-oriented health care entity and an outside party other than a donor or grantor.  Examples include assets set aside under debt agreements, assets set aside under self-insurance (risk-retention) funding arrangements, and assets set aside to meet statutory reserve requirements (such as those required under state law for many health maintenance organizations).  (See paragraph 954-810-45-4.)
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Interfund Receivables or payables</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-3</b>  Interfund receivables (or payables) may exist in internal records.  However, since general-purpose financial statements of not-for-profit, business-oriented health care entities d no classify assets and liabilities into fund groups, interfund receivables (or payables) are eliminated.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;  Assets Limited as to Use</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45-4</b>  Internally designated funds shall be reported separately form externally designated funds either on the face of the balance sheet or in the notes to the financial statements.
