</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; General Concepts </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-2   </b>In concept, <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">interest cost</b> is capitalizable for all assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">intended use</b> (an acquisition period). However, in many cases, the benefit in terms of information about the entity's resources and earnings may not justify the additional accounting and administrative cost involved in providing the information. The significance of the effect of interest capitalization in relation to the entity's resources and earnings is the most important consideration in assessing its benefit. The ease with which qualifying assets and related <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">expenditures</b> can be separately identified and the number of assets subject to interest capitalization are important factors in assessing the cost of implementation. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-3   </b>Interest capitalization is required only when the balance of the informational benefit and the cost of implementation is favorable. A favorable balance is most likely to be achieved where an asset is constructed or produced as a discrete project for which costs are separately accumulated and where construction of the asset takes considerable time, entails substantial expenditures, and is likely to involve a significant amount of interest cost. A favorable balance is unlikely in the case of inventory items that are routinely manufactured or otherwise produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis. Accordingly, this Subtopic proscribes interest capitalization on those types of inventories (that is, inventory items that are routinely manufactured or produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis) and provides for interest capitalization on assets that are constructed or produced as discrete projects. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">815-4   </b>Minimum threshold levels are common in inventory and property, plant, and equipment accounting. Many entities do not include the costs of minor items in inventory, and many entities do not capitalize individual items of property, plant, and equipment, the costs of which are less than a specified threshold. Such thresholds are designed to minimize the burden of capitalizing large numbers of assets and accounting for those costs as the assets are used. Those thresholds are justified on the grounds that the assets whose costs are charged to expense as purchased are immaterial both individually and in the aggregate. This Subtopic does not affect the use of threshold levels established in conformity with such materiality tests.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt;  Assets for Which Interest Shall Be Capitalized </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-5   </b>Interest shall be capitalized for the following types of assets (qualifying assets): 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Assets that are constructed or otherwise produced for an entity's own use, including assets constructed or produced for the entity by others for which deposits or progress payments have been made. 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Assets intended for sale or lease that are constructed or otherwise produced as discrete projects (for example, ships or real estate developments). 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Investments (equity, loans, and advances) accounted for by the equity method while the investee has <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">activities</b> in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations provided that the investee's activities include the use of funds to acquire qualifying assets for its operations. The investor's investment in the investee, not the individual assets or projects of the investee, is the qualifying asset for purposes of interest capitalization. 
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Assets for Which Interest Shall Not Be Capitalized </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-6   </b>Interest shall not be capitalized for the following types of assets: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  Assets that are in use or ready for their intended use in the earning activities of the entity </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b.  Assets that are not being used in the earning activities of the entity and that are not undergoing the activities necessary to get them ready for use </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c.  Assets that are not included in the consolidated balance sheet of the parent entity and consolidated subsidiaries </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  Investments accounted for by the equity method after the planned principal operations of the investee begin (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">835-20-55-2</u> for clarification of the phrase <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">after planned principal operations begin</i>) </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e.  Investments in regulated investees that are capitalizing both the cost of debt and equity capital (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">835-20-55-3</u> for guidance on capitalization of costs by a regulated investee) </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">f.  Assets acquired with gifts and grants that are restricted by the donor or grantor to acquisition of those assets to the extent that funds are available from such gifts and grants. Interest earned from temporary investment of those funds that is similarly restricted shall be considered an addition to the gift or grant for this purpose. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">g.  Inventories that are routinely manufactured or otherwise produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis. </p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-7    </b>Accretion expense related to exit costs and asset retirement obligations shall not be considered to be interest cost for purposes of applying this Subtopic. See Topic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">420</u> or Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">410-20</u> for guidance on those areas. The interest cost component of net periodic pension cost shall not be considered to be interest for purposes of applying this Subtopic. See Subtopic <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30</u> for guidance.

<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; </b>Capitalization of Land Expenditures </p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">15-8   </b>Land that is not undergoing activities necessary to get it ready for its intended use is not a qualifying asset. If activities are undertaken for the purpose of developing land for a particular use, the expenditures to acquire the land qualify for interest capitalization while those activities are in progress. The interest cost capitalized on those expenditures is a cost of acquiring the asset that results from those activities. If the resulting asset is a structure, such as a plant or a shopping center, interest capitalized on the land expenditures is part of the acquisition cost of the structure. If the resulting asset is developed land, such as land that is to be sold as developed lots, interest capitalized on the land expenditures is part of the acquisition cost of the developed land.
