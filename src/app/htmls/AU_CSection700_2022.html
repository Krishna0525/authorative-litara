				being audited or to those charged with governance. A report on the financial statements of an
				unincorporated entity may be addressed as circumstances dictate (for example, to the partners, general
				partner, or propri- etor). Occasionally, an auditor may be retained to audit the financial statements of

			</P>
			<P class="p149 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A27 </SPAN>The auditor's report states, for example, that the auditor
				has "audited the financial statements of ABC Company, which comprise the balance sheet as of December
				31, 20X1, and the related statements of income, changes in stock- holders' equity, and cash flows for
				the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements." If the financial statements
				include a separate state- ment of changes in stockholders' equity accounts or a separate statement of
				comprehensive income, paragraph .25<SPAN class="ft4">c </SPAN>requires such statements to be identi-
				fied in the "Opinion" section, but they need not be referred to separately in the opinion paragraph
				because changes in stockholders' equity accounts and com- prehensive income are considered part of the
				presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.</P>
			<P class="p204 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A28 </SPAN>The identification of the title and the dates of, or
				periods covered by, each statement that the financial statements comprise may also be achieved by
				referencing the table of contents in a document bound with or accompanying the financial statements and
				auditor's report thereon.</P>
			<P class="p48 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A29 </SPAN>When the auditor is aware that the audited financial
				statements will be included in a document that contains information in addition to the finan- cial
				statements and the auditor's report thereon, the auditor may consider, if the form of presentation
				allows, identifying the page numbers on which the au- dited financial statements are presented. This
				helps users identify the financial statements to which the auditor's report relates.</P>
			<P class="p123 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A30 </SPAN>When the auditor expresses an unmodified opinion, it is
				not appro- priate to use phrases such as "with the foregoing explanation" or "subject to" in relation to
				the opinion because these suggest a conditional opinion or a weak- ening or modification of the opinion.
			</P>
			<P class="p175 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A31 </SPAN>The auditor's opinion covers the complete set of financial
				statements, as defined by the applicable financial reporting framework. For example, in the case of many
				general purpose frameworks, the financial statements include a balance sheet, an income statement, a
				statement of changes in equity, and a cash flow statement, including related notes. In some
				circumstances, additional or different statements, schedules, or information also might be considered an
				integral part of the financial statements.</P>

				charged with governance accept responsibility for the prepa- ration of the financial statements in

				Management also ac- cepts responsibility for the design, implementation, and maintenance of in- ternal
				control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
				material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The description of management's responsibilities
				in the auditor's re- port includes reference to both of these responsibilities because it helps explain
				to users the premise on which an audit is conducted. Section 260 uses the term <SPAN class="ft4">those
					charged with governance </SPAN>to describe the persons or organizations with responsibility for
				overseeing the entity, and provides a discussion about the di- versity of governance structures among
				entities.</P>
			<P class="p213 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A42 </SPAN>In some instances, a document containing the auditor's

				about the responsibilities of manage- ment or those charged with governance regarding the preparation of
				the fi- nancial statements, or reference to a separate statement by management or those charged with
				governance about such responsibilities if one is included in a document containing the auditor's report,

				made by management or those charged with governance about their responsibility for financial reporting,
				internal control, and other matters that might be discussed in the management report.</P>

			<P class="p182 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A60 </SPAN>As discussed in paragraph .46, because the auditor is
				required to also conduct the audit in accordance with GAAS, it would be inappropriate for the auditor to
				issue a report that refers only to the standards of the PCAOB without also referring to GAAS.</P>
			<P class="p228 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A61 </SPAN>When the auditor follows the standards of the PCAOB
				regarding the form of the auditor's report, PCAOB reporting requirements for specific circum- stances,
				such as reporting on an integrated audit or supplementary informa- tion, may also be applicable.</P>
			<P class="p229 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">.A62 </SPAN>The form of the auditor's report required by the
				standards of the PCAOB states that the audit was conducted in accordance with "the standards of the
				Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)." A refer- ence to "the standards" of the
				PCAOB indicates that the auditor has complied not only with the PCAOB's auditing standards but also with
				the related pro- fessional practice standards of the PCAOB, including its independence rules; whereas a
				reference to "the auditing standards of the Public Company Account- ing Oversight Board (United States)"
				indicates compliance with only the audit- ing standards of the PCAOB. The auditor of financial
				statements of an entity whose audits are not within the jurisdiction of the PCAOB may, nevertheless, be
				responsible for complying with the independence and other related professional practice standards of the
				PCAOB if, for example, the engagement is subject to regulatory oversight that requires compliance with
				those rules. Whether the auditor conducts an audit of financial statements in accordance with the stan-
				dards of the PCAOB or the auditing standards of the PCAOB depends on the circumstances of the
				engagement.<SPAN class="ft12">29</SPAN></P>
			<P class="p230 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A63 </SPAN>Examples of situations in which an auditor may be engaged
				to con- duct an audit in accordance with the standards (or auditing standards) of the PCAOB for an
				entity whose audit is not within the jurisdiction of the PCAOB include audits for clearing agencies and
				futures commission merchants regis- tered with the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),
				as well as other entities registered with the CFTC; audits of financial statements in- cluded in certain
				securities offering documents pursuant to Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933; and circumstances
				in which a nonissuer company de- sires, or is required by contractual agreement, to obtain an audit of
				its financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.</P>
			<P class="p231 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A64 </SPAN>When an audit is being conducted in accordance with the
				standards of the PCAOB, the auditor would follow the relevant requirements in the PCAOB standards
				regarding the determination and reporting of critical audit matters. This would not affect the
				requirement for the auditor to state in the auditor's report that the audit was also conducted in
				accordance with GAAS, as required by paragraph .46 of this section.</P>

			<P class="p42 ft23">Other Considerations Relating to Comparative Financial Statements</P>
			<P class="p175 ft21"><SPAN class="ft39">.A69 </SPAN>If one firm of independent auditors merges with another
				firm, and the new firm becomes the auditor of a former client of one of the two former firms, the new
				firm may accept responsibility and express an opinion on the financial statements for the prior periods,
				as well as on those for the current period. In such circumstances, <NOBR>paragraphs .47–.60</NOBR>
				apply. The new firm may indicate in the auditor's report or as part of the signature that a merger took
				place and may name the firm of independent auditors that was merged with it. If the new firm decides not
				to express an opinion on the prior period financial statements, the guidance for the reissuance of
				reports in section 560 would apply.</P>
			<P class="p125 ft23">Comparative Information (Ref: <NOBR>par. .49–.50)</NOBR>
			</P>
			<P class="p236 ft5"><SPAN class="ft0">.A70 </SPAN>Comparative information, which may be condensed financial
				state- ments or prior period summarized financial information, is not considered comparative financial
				statements because it is not a complete set of financial statements. For example, entities such as state
				and local governmental units frequently present <NOBR>total-all-funds</NOBR> information for the prior
				periods rather than information by individual funds because of space limitations or to avoid cumbersome
				or confusing formats. Also, <NOBR>not-for-profit</NOBR> organizations frequently present certain
				summarized financial information for the prior periods in to- tal rather than by net asset class.
				Accordingly, the auditor need not opine on comparative information in accordance with this section.</P>
			<P class="p48 ft10"><SPAN class="ft8">.A71 </SPAN>Paragraph .49 requires the auditor to clearly indicate the
				character of the auditor's work, if any, and the degree of responsibility the auditor is tak- ing in the
				auditor's report when comparative information is presented but not covered by the auditor's opinion on
				the financial statements of the current pe- riod. The requirements and guidance in section 930, <SPAN

				the current period, the auditor becomes aware of circumstances or events that materially affect the
