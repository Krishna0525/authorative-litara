<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Use of Reasonable Approximations</b>
</p><p id="71535">
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-1</b>  This Subtopic is intended to specify accounting objectives and results rather than specific computational means of obtaining those results. If estimates, averages, or computational shortcuts can reduce the cost of applying this Subtopic, their use is appropriate, provided the results are reasonably expected not to be materially different from the results of a detailed application. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Benefit Obligations</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-1A</b>  The <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">projected benefit obligation</b> as of a date is the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">actuarial present value</b> of all benefits attributed by the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">plan's benefit formula</b> to employee service rendered before that date. The projected benefit obligation is measured using an <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">assumption</b> as to future compensation levels if the pension <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">benefit formula</b> is based on those future compensation levels. Plans for which the pension benefit formula is based on future compensation are sometimes called pay-related, <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">final-pay</b>, final-average-pay, or <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">career-average-pay</b> plans. Plans for which the pension benefit formula is not based on future compensation levels are called non-pay-related or <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">flat-benefit plans</b>. The projected benefit obligation is a measure of benefits attributed to service to date assuming that the plan continues in effect and that estimated future events (including compensation increases, <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">turnover</b>, and <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">mortality</b>) occur. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-2</b>  The <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">accumulated benefit obligation</b> as of a date is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered before that date and based on current and past compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that it includes no assumption about future compensation levels. For plans with flat-benefit or non-pay-related pension benefit formulas, the accumulated benefit obligation and the projected benefit obligation are the same. The accumulated benefit obligation and the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">vested benefit obligation</b> provide information about the obligation the employer would have if the plan were discontinued. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt; Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-3</b>  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Net periodic pension cost </b>has often been viewed as a single homogeneous amount, but in fact it is made up of several components that reflect different aspects of the employer's financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by employees. The cost of a benefit can be determined without regard to how the employer decides to finance the plan. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-35-4</b>  All of the following components shall be included in the net pension cost recognized for a period by an employer sponsoring a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">defined benefit pension plan</b>: 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">a.  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Service cost</b>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">b. <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interest cost</b>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">c. <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actual return on plan assets</b>, if any
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">d.  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amortization</b> of any<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> prior service cost</b> or credit included in accumulated other comprehensive income </p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">e. <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gain or loss </b>(including the effects of changes in <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">assumptions</b>), which includes, to the extent recognized (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-26</u>), amortization of the net gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Amortization of any net transition asset or obligation existing at the date of initial application of this Subtopic and remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income.
</p>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-5</b>  Note that both the <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">return on plan assets</b> and interest cost components are in substance financial items rather than employee compensation costs. An employer may have net periodic pension cost that is a net credit (that is, net periodic pension income) as noted in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-55-3</u>.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Service Cost</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-6</b>  The service cost component of net periodic pension cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plan's benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the period. The service cost component is conceptually the same for an unfunded plan, a plan with minimal funding, and a well-funded plan. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-7</b>  The measurement of the service cost component requires use of an attribution method and assumptions. That measurement is discussed in paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-35-29 through 35-46</u>. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Interest Cost</b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-8</b>  The interest cost component of net periodic pension cost is interest on the projected benefit obligation, which is a discounted amount. Measuring the projected benefit obligation as a present value requires accrual of an interest cost at rates equal to the assumed <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">discount rates</b>. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-9</b>  The interest cost component of net periodic pension cost shall not be considered interest for purposes of applying Subtopic <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">835-20</i>. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&gt;&gt; Prior Service Costs </b>
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-10</b>  <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plan amendments </b>(including initiation of a plan) often include provisions that grant increased benefits based on services rendered in prior periods. Because plan amendments are granted with the expectation that the employer will realize economic benefits in future periods, this Subtopic does not require the cost of providing such retroactive benefits (that is, prior service cost) to be included in net periodic pension cost entirely in the year of the amendment, absent the conditions addressed in paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-35-16</u>, but provides for recognition during the future service periods of those employees active at the date of the amendment who are expected to receive benefits under the plan. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-11</b>  A plan amendment that retroactively increases benefits (including benefits that are granted to retirees) increases the projected benefit obligation. The cost of the benefit improvement shall be recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income at the date of the amendment. Except as specified in paragraphs <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-35-13 through 35-16</u>, that prior service cost shall be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost by assigning an equal amount to each future period of service of each employee active at the date of the amendment who is expected to receive benefits under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the cost of retroactive plan amendments affecting benefits of inactive participants shall be amortized based on the remaining life expectancy of those participants instead of based on the remaining service period. Other comprehensive income is adjusted each period as prior service cost is amortized. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-12</b>  See Example 1 (paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-55-93</u>) for an illustration of this guidance to amortize prior service cost.
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-13</b>  To reduce the complexity and detail of the computations required, consistent use of an alternative approach that more rapidly amortizes the cost of retroactive amendments is acceptable. For example, a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan is acceptable. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-14</b>  In some situations a history of regular plan amendments and other evidence may indicate that the period during which the employer expects to realize economic benefits from an amendment granting retroactive benefits is shorter than the entire remaining service period of the active employees. Identification of such situations requires an assessment of the individual circumstances and the substance of the particular plan situation. In those circumstances, the amortization of prior service cost shall be accelerated to reflect the more rapid expiration of the employer's economic benefits and to recognize the cost in the periods benefited. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-15</b>  Once a schedule of amortization of prior service cost from a specific retroactive plan amendment has been established, that schedule generally should not be revised. The initial schedule shall be revised only if a <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">curtailment</b> occurs (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-35-92</u>) or if events indicate that the period during which the employer expects to realize future economic benefits from the retroactive plan amendment giving rise to the prior service cost is shorter than originally estimated or the future economic benefits have been impaired. The schedule shall not be revised because of ordinary variances in expected service lives of employees, nor shall the schedule be revised so that the prior service cost is recognized in net periodic pension cost more slowly. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-16</b>  Prior service cost is recognized immediately in other comprehensive income, unless, based on an assessment of the facts and circumstances, the employer does not expect to realize any future economic benefits from that retroactive plan amendment (see paragraph <u xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">715-30-35-14</u>). However, this Subtopic does not permit an accounting policy to recognize immediately as a component of net periodic pension cost the cost of all plan amendments that grant increased benefits for services rendered in prior periods. Adopting an accounting policy to recognize prior service cost immediately in net periodic pension cost would preclude making that assessment for future plan amendments as they occur. 
</p><p>
<b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">35-17</b>  A plan amendment that retroactively reduces, rather than increases, benefits decreases the projected benefit obligation. The reduction in benefits shall be recognized as a credit (prior service credit) to other comprehensive income that shall be used first to reduce any remaining prior service cost included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any remaining prior service credit shall be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost on the same basis as the cost of a benefit increase.
